## Linear Transformations (continued)

If **A** in (11) is square,  $n \times n$ , then (11) maps  $R^n$  into  $R^n$ . If this **A** is nonsingular, so that  $A^{-1}$  exists (see Sec. 7.8), then multiplication of (11) by  $A^{-1}$  from the left and use of  $A^{-1}A = I$  gives the **inverse transformation**

$$(14) \quad x = A^{-1}y.$$

It maps every  $y = y_0$  onto that  $x$ , which by (11) is mapped onto  $y_0$ . *The inverse of a linear transformation is itself linear*, because it is given by a matrix, as (14) shows.
