## B Do a survey.

Please interview your friends and find out what they would like  
to do on special days.

What's your favourite  
special day?

My favourite special day is  
Teachers' Day. It's coming soon.

What would you  
like to do?

I'd like to buy some flowers and  
make a card for my teacher.

Would you like to  
make a phone call  
or send a message?

I'd like to call her.
