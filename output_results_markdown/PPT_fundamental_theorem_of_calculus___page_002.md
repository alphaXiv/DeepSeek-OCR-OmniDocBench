To estimate area A  
under  $y = 3x^2$  from  
 $x = 2$  to  $x = 4$ 

we could split it into small rectangles:

With 4 rectangles,  
the area  $\approx 48.96$  units $^2$ 

Graph showing the curve  $y = 3x^2$ . The area A under the curve, bounded by  $x=2$  and  $x=4$ , and the x-axis, is highlighted by two thick vertical lines at  $x=2$  and  $x=4$ . The region between these lines is labeled 'A'. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 60.

Graph showing the curve  $y = 3x^2$ . The area under the curve between  $x=2$  and  $x=4$  is approximated using 4 blue rectangles of equal width. The rectangles are constructed using the right endpoints (upper sum approximation).
