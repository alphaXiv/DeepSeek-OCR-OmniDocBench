## SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 7

### Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems

(continued 3)

The **transpose**  $A^T$  of a matrix  $A = [a_{jk}]$  is  $A^T = [a_{kj}]$ ; rows become columns and conversely (Sec. 7.2). Here,  $A$  need not be square. If it is and  $A = A^T$ , then  $A$  is called **symmetric**; if  $A = -A^T$ , it is called **skew-symmetric**.

For a product,  $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$  (Sec. 7.2).

A main application of matrices concerns **linear systems of equations**

$$(2) \hfill Ax = b \hfill \text{(Sec. 7.3)}$$

( $m$  equations in  $n$  unknowns  $x_1, \dots, x_n$ ;  $A$  and  $b$  given).
