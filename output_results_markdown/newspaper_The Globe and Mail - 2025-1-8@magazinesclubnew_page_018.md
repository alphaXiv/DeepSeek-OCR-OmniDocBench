# Canadian exports to U.S. rose in November

Surplus may have political significance amid Trump's complaints about the trade deficit

MARK RENDELL

Canada posted its ninth-consecutive trade deficit in November, but its trade surplus with the United States grew that month, highlighting a key economic dynamic that has political implications ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month.

Canada's total merchandise trade exports increased 2.2 per cent in November, while imports increased 1.8 per cent, narrowing the country's trade deficit with the rest of the world to \$323-million from a downwardly revised \$544-million the month before, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.

At the same time, the long-standing goods trade surplus with the United States increased to \$8.2-billion from \$6.6-billion in October, with exports to the U.S. up 6.8 per cent month-to-month and imports up 4.1 per cent.

That monthly trade surplus – the result of Canada exporting more to the United States than it imports – is on the small side, compared to the average in re-

cent years. However, it may carry larger political significance than usual, given Mr. Trump's complaints about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and his threats of tariffs.

The president-elect has promised to slap 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian imports if Ottawa does not address American concerns about border security. Mr. Trump has also complained about his country's merchandise trade deficit with Canada, which has averaged a little over \$100-billion annually for the past three years on around \$1.1-trillion in annual two-way trade. The trade deficit is

smaller when services are taken into account.

"We lose in trade deficits. We're losing massive," Mr. Trump said of trade with Canada in a news conference on Tuesday. "You know, they make 20 per cent of our cars. We don't need that. I'd rather make them in Detroit. We don't need their cars. We don't need their lumber. ... We don't need their dairy products. We have more than they have. We don't need anything."

Canada's trade-oriented economy relies heavily on access to the U.S. market. It's the destination for around 75 per cent of Can-

adian exports, including \$166-billion worth of oil and gas exports and \$85-billion worth of vehicle and auto parts exports in 2023. High and broad-based tariffs could push Canada into a recession and stunt business investment.

"The outlook for Canadian trade in 2025 is cloudy at best," Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Marc Ercolao wrote in a note to clients. "Our base case is that Canada largely avoids a full-scale implementation of Trump's tariff plan, given our energy-heavy relationship with the U.S. – though we acknowledge that any tariff levied against Canada has negative consequences for economic growth."

The increase in overall Canadian exports was broad-based in November, with metals and non-metallic ores up 10.5 per cent, industrial machinery and parts up 3.8 per cent and aircraft and transportation equipment up 6.7 per cent. Energy exports rose 2.2 per cent, with a 4.8-per-cent jump in crude oil exports on stronger prices.

Motor-vehicle exports, by contrast, contracted 1.2 per cent in November and remain considerably lower than a year ago.

Canada's exports to the U.S. have been helped in recent months by a depreciation in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, which makes Canadian products more appealing to American buyers.

Exports may also be getting a boost as companies try to "front-run" potential tariffs by moving goods across the border pre-emptively. A survey of more than 300 Canadian companies in December, conducted by the organization Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, found that about one-third are accelerating shipments to the U.S.

In volume terms, total exports were up 0.5 per cent in November.

"The third consecutive rise in export volumes in November provides further evidence that the economy was gaining momentum at the end of last year," Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. "U.S. tariffs could cause the recovery to go into reverse this year, but that threat might provide some further support in the near term if U.S. importers try to front-run the tariffs."

Merchandise exports to countries other than the U.S. decreased 10.3 per cent in November, driven by lower shipments of gold to Hong Kong and nickel to Norway. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States widened to \$8.5-billion in November from \$7.2-billion in October.

Service exports, meanwhile, contracted 0.2 per cent, leaving the services trade deficit at about \$300-million, essentially unchanged from the previous month.

## Ottawa to release letter clarifying rules on private pay for primary care

CHRIS HANNAY

Ottawa says it is still working on a long-promised letter clarifying the rules around out-of-pocket pay for primary health care services despite political upheaval in the capital, continuing months of delays that have created uncertainty for private providers.

An estimated six million Canadians are not connected to a family doctor, and many have turned to alternate health care providers such as virtual care companies that may charge subscription or membership fees for services that would otherwise be covered by public insurance.

Nearly two years ago, then-minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos said he was "very concerned" about recent increases in Canadians paying out-of-pocket for medically necessary care.

He pledged to release an interpretation letter outlining the rules governing nurse practitioners and other non-physician health care providers as they relate to the Canada Health Act, which was passed in 1984 and only explicitly covers services from physicians and in hospitals.

In the intervening years, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals have been granted new authorities to order tests, prescribe medications and provide other services that would otherwise come from a primary-care physician. But they have been left in a grey area that allows them to operate as both public and private providers in a way physicians are barred from.

Mark Holland, the Health Minister since July, 2023, has continued to promise legal clarity, but a letter has so far not been released.

On Tuesday, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's move to prorogue Parliament and announcement that he will resign as Liberal Leader once a successor is determined, Mr. Holland's office provided few details when contacted by The Globe and Mail.

"We hope to have more to say on the upcoming letter soon," spokesperson Matthew Kronberg said in an e-mail.

The delays have caused continued uncertainty for both those calling for more private health care options and those who say it is a drain on the publicly funded system.

Brett Belchetz, a Toronto physician and chief executive officer of telemedicine platform Maple, has said such companies are necessary for Canadians who don't have a family doctor.

He said he is opposed to the type of user fees that "paywall" access to health care providers who then bill public insurance for their services. However, services that are funded 100 per cent by patients or private insurance should be welcomed, he added.

"This is how options like employer-funded virtual care have come to be, which millions of Canadians rely on when they can't find support in our overburdened public health system," Dr. Belchetz wrote in a LinkedIn post last year.

The Canadian Medical Association has recommended that the federal government ban membership fees, user fees or other sorts of payment for primary-care services covered by public insurance.

CMA president Jooss Reimer, who is a physician in Manitoba, said the association's top concern is that the growth of private providers is siphoning professionals away from the publicly funded system. That could lead to worsening work force shortages in the public system, which leads to even less access to public services, in a negative feedback loop.

"Whenever we have providers that are using out-of-pocket, or private pay options, they are being pulled out of the public system to provide that service," Dr. Reimer said.

Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones wrote to her federal counterpart last April recommending that non-physician health care providers be banned from charging fees to provide primary-care services.

"I am asking for your department and your government consult and work with provinces and territories on a Canada-wide solution to close this loophole, to guard against unintended consequences, and prohibit nonphysicians from charging for publicly funded services," the letter says.

Ema Popovic, spokesperson for Ms. Jones, said Ontario is still waiting on a response from Ottawa to their letter.

## Former CIBC CEO Hunkin dies at 79

ANDREW WILLIS  
JAMES BRADSHAW

Former Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce chief executive officer John Hunkin, who tore down silos in financial services, died Monday at the age of 79.

Several sources said Mr. Hunkin died of a heart attack.

In a message to CIBC employees, chief executive officer Victor Dodig said: "John was an inspiring leader at our bank, who emphasized our potential for growth and believed deeply in our ability to lead."

Over a 36-year career at CIBC, Mr. Hunkin led the bank's expansion in the U.S. market and directed the union of investment dealer Wood Gundy, acquired after the 1987 stock market crash, with CIBC's traditional corporate lender.

As the bank's CEO from 1999 to 2005, Mr. Hunkin oversaw a lucrative push into financing technology companies. He also dealt with the fallout from the collapse of Enron Corp., with CIBC paying billions to settle lawsuits filed by investors in the failed energy trader.

"John was willing to be innovative and creative and made bold moves in the capital markets businesses which are responsible for the strong franchise CIBC has today," said Richard Venn, a former CIBC executive and founding partner at Further Global Capital Management.

Mr. Hunkin grew up in the bank's culture – his father was CIBC's head of human resources. Mr. Hunkin joined CIBC in 1969 after earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Manitoba in 1967 and his MBA from York University two years later.

He supported York throughout his career, as a member of its board, foundation and business school's advisory council. He also volunteered at downtown Toron-

to's St. Michael's Hospital.

"John was a remarkable person in so many ways," said Melissa Martin, the chair of the St. Michael's Hospital Foundation. "He had an extraordinary business career, but beyond that he was a magnificent fundraiser."

In 2011, Mr. Hunkin played a key role in securing a \$25-million donation to St. Michael's from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, who had a significant investment in CIBC. Ms. Martin said the donation "ignited the hospital's research initiatives and elevated our scientists' work to new heights."

Mr. Hunkin also supported Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts Foundation. In 2019, Governor-General Julie Payette awarded him the Order of Canada.

Early in his banking career, he moved to London to help open CIBC's European credit division, a new territory for the bank. The pioneering role caught the eye of CIBC executive Don Fullerton, who subsequently became CEO. He tasked Mr. Hunkin and colleague Al Flood with setting a strategy for U.S. expansion. The two bankers moved to New York and built a successful corporate lending team, run by Mr. Flood, who went on to succeed Mr. Fullerton as the bank's CEO and Mr. Hunkin's predecessor.

In the late 1980s, the federal government liberalized financial regulations, allowing banks to own investment dealers. CIBC acquired Wood Gundy after the dealer lost much of its capital in the 1987 market crash. Initially, the two cultures clashed.

To bridge the gulf, Mr. Hunkin quit his corporate lending job at CIBC, giving up his seniority at the bank, to become head of the investment banking team. Under his leadership, CIBC became the first domestic lender to bring corporate and investment banking under one roof.

"John was the first banker to cross the line, to turn his back on his career as a corporate banker and jump into investment dealer, and he did it well," said David Kassie, head of investment banking at CIBC and former chair and CEO at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. "John excelled at building client relationships and was a really good manager of people."

"Putting an investment dealer and a bank together was uncharted territory, but John made it happen, mainly because everyone trusted him," said Tom Woods, CIBC's former chief financial officer. "He was not afraid to take risks. CIBC's electronic banking initiative in the U.S. was years ahead of its time, but ultimately had to be wound up."

In 1999, Mr. Flood retired as CEO, and the CIBC board faced a choice between Mr. Hunkin and head of retail banking Holger Kluge as his successor. When Mr. Hunkin got the nod, Mr. Kluge departed.

Over the first half of Mr. Hunkin's tenure as CEO, CIBC outperformed rivals, cashing in on investments in client companies such as fibre-optic network Global Crossing Ltd. CIBC became a leader in wealth management by acquiring the retail brokerage network of Merrill Lynch Canada Inc. for \$600-million.

Mr. Hunkin spent the final years of his banking career dealing with Enron litigation. His successor, Gerry McCaughey, eventually settled the lawsuits for \$2.5-billion.

Mr. Hunkin retired in 2005, and he and his wife, Susan Crocker, a former CIBC executive and CEO of the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, moved to Chester, N.S. That summer, he skippered his newly acquired 48-foot yacht in the biennial Marblehead to Halifax Ocean Race, a 360-mile event from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia. He and his 12-person crew finished first among Canadian entrants.

Whenever we have providers that are using out-of-pocket, or private pay options, they are being pulled out of the public system to provide that service.
