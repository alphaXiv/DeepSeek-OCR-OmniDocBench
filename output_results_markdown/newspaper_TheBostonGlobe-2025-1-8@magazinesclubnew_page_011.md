MetroTHE BOSTON GLOBE WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2025 | BOSTONGLOBE.COM/METRONorovirus cases in Mass. surged in 2024By Camilo FonsecaGLOBE STAFFMirroring a national trend, cases of the norovirus stomach bug are surging in Massachusetts this winter, according to state data.

The state reported 2,080 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in 2024 in preliminary data released last week by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. That represents a jump of roughly 66 percent from the previous year, when the state reported 1,252 cases.

Cases over the winter have so far outpaced the previous year, with 134 cases reported in November and 279 reported in December. In 2023, there were 52 cases reported in November and 112 in December.

Officials say 66% jump in a year reflects US trend; call handwashing best defensePublic health officials say they have been monitoring the increase in cases.

Nationally, cases of the virus are surging in parts of the United States this winter, according to government data.

The most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show there were 91 outbreaks of norovirus reported during the week of Dec. 5, up from 69 outbreaks the last week of November.

Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.

Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, according to state health officials. Despite being one of the most common causes of foodborne illness, the virus is difficult to detect in a laboratory, and specialized norovirus tests are usually conducted only in certain circumstances.

A spokesperson for the DPH said the uptick in cases may be attributed in part to more modern testing methods which can detect multiple pathogens at once. They also noted that certain test devices were recently found to be prone to false

positives of norovirus.

Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.

People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people, and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.

There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea, and alcohol.

NOROVIRUS, Page B3Population rise in Mass. is largest in 60 yearsCensus figures show increase largely driven by influx of immigrantsBy Sam DrysdaleSTATE HOUSE NEWSFueled by the highest immigration levels in decades, Massachusetts saw its largest population increase in 60 years between 2023 and 2024, and the rate of domestic outmigration has significantly slowed, according to US Census data released last month.

Between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024, the state's population increased 69,603 from 7,066,568 to 7,136,171 — an increase of just under 1 percent (0.985 percent).

That's the largest annual percentage increase that Massachusetts has experienced since between 2012 and 2013, according to a UMass Donahue Institute analysis of the December US Census population estimates.

Numbers-wise, it's the largest annual population increase since the end of the baby boom in 1964.

Those gains made Massachusetts the fastest growing state in New England and the second-fastest growing state in the Northeast after New Jersey, according to the institute.

The largest driver: immigration, estimated at 90,217 incoming immigrants between 2023 and 2024. The census estimates that's the highest immigration level since at least 1990.

"While immigration is the single largest driver of population change in Massachusetts ... other factors also play a role," according to the institute's analysis. "In 2024, Massachusetts saw more births (67,851) than deaths (61,133), contributing 6,718, on net, to the population growth in Massachusetts."

Massachusetts has seen an influx of thousands of refugees and migrants — seeking asylum from wars, political unrest, and environmental disasters — who have sought temporary housing in the state's emergency family shelter system, straining the physical and financial limits of the system. The census data does not delineate between immigrants legally seeking asylum or refuge and those otherwise entering the country.

Domestic outmigration, the term used to describe people moving out of one state to another state, has been a contentious political topic for the past several years, as many young adults and families left Massachusetts in the early days of the pandemic, settling in states with lower costs of living.

Conservatives point to high taxes as the reason for domestic outmigration, calling on Democrats to lower tax burdens to keep Bay Staters from moving. Progressives, on the other hand, have pointed to high housing and child care costs, and called for more state investment in programs to

Boston traffic ranked fourth worst in nationBy Shannon LarsonGLOBE STAFFIn what will come as no surprise to any Boston driver: We're still stuck in traffic. The city continues to rank in the top-five most congested cities in the United States and among the worst worldwide.

Still, Boston traffic is generally improving. Unless, that is, you're heading south on I-93 after work.

The average motorist traversing Boston spent 79 hours stuck in traffic in 2024, according to an annual study from INRIX, a transportation analytics company. In 2023, that average driver lost 88 hours.

That 10 percent drop is the largest for any of the top 25 most congested American cities.

Study finds drivers here spent an average 79 hours stuck in traffic last yearSome key factors, according to the Mass. Department of Transportation, include investments in infrastructure, such as optimized traffic signals and dedicated bus lines; public transit enhancements; more people choosing biking or walking; and folks adjusting their commuting schedules.

"We're encouraged by this progress, but know there's still work to be done," said the state highway administrator, Jonathan Gulliver.

Worldwide, congestion again edged closer to pre-pandemic levels as more than half of the urban areas

studied experienced an increase in traffic — a trend driven, in part, by workers returning to the office. Istanbul, Mexico City, London, and Paris were among the most congested cities, according to the study.

In the US last year, the average worker lost 43 hours to traffic jams, the equivalent of a work week, INRIX found.

"Traffic can be an indicator of economic boon, but ironically, it's a hamper on economies in of itself. Each minute spent waiting in traffic results in money and productivity lost," said Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX and author of the report, which determined that \$74 billion was lost to congestion nationwide.
