# Partial Derivatives

![3D plot of a function of two variables, C(x, y), showing a complex surface with peaks and valleys. The X-axis is marked 1 to 19, and the Y-axis is marked S1 to S19. The Z-axis ranges from -1.5 to 3.]()The surface is color-coded based on the Z-value (vertical axis), according to the following ranges:

- 2.5–3
- 2–2.5
- 1.5–2
- 1–1.5
- 0.5–1
- 0–0.5
- –0.5–0
- –1– –0.5
- –1.5– –1

- Functions of more than one variable

- Example:  $C(x,y) = x^4 + y^3 + xy$
