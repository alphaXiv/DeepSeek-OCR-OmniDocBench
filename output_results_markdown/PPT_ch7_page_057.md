Linear Independence and Dependence of VectorsGiven any set of  $m$  vectors  $\mathbf{a}_{(1)}, \dots, \mathbf{a}_{(m)}$  (with the same number of components), a **linear combination** of these vectors is an expression of the form

$$c_1 \mathbf{a}_{(1)} + c_2 \mathbf{a}_{(2)} + \dots + c_m \mathbf{a}_{(m)}$$

where  $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$  are any scalars.

Now consider the equation

$$(1) \quad c_1 \mathbf{a}_{(1)} + c_2 \mathbf{a}_{(2)} + \dots + c_m \mathbf{a}_{(m)} = \mathbf{0}$$

Clearly, *this vector equation (1) holds if we choose all  $c_j$ 's zero, because then it becomes  $\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}$ .*

If this is the only  $m$ -tuple of scalars for which (1) holds, then our vectors  $\mathbf{a}_{(1)}, \dots, \mathbf{a}_{(m)}$  are said to form a *linearly independent set* or, more briefly, we call them **linearly independent**.
