After an lot of algebra, it would probably come to an expression similar to this:

$$\textit{Area} = \lim_{\text{as } h \to 0} 56( 1 + 2h + 4h^2 + 8h^3 + \dots )$$

$$= 56 \textit{units}^2$$

*Unfortunately, simplifying the expression into something like the above is extremely difficult. (see pages 285 \text{--} 288 in my book)*
