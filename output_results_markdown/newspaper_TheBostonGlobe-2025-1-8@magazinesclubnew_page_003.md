HONG KONG — Using their hands and shovels in frigid conditions, rescue workers dug through the rubble in the search for survivors after a deadly 7.1 magnitude earthquake toppled houses and jolted people awake in a remote part of Tibet on Tuesday near the northern foothills of Mount Everest.

At least 126 people have died and 188 were injured in the quake, which struck shortly after 9 a.m. at a depth of 6.2 miles in Dingri County, near one of Tibet's most historic cities, in western China, state media reported. The quake was the country's deadliest since December 2023, when 151 people were killed in a 6.2 magnitude tremor in the northwestern provinces of Gansu and Qinghai.

China's state broadcaster reported that more than 1,000 houses had experienced some form of damage in Dingri County, where the average altitude is around 15,000 feet, along the Himalayan border with Nepal.

Frantic rescue efforts were being conducted without heavy equipment, underscoring the challenge of delivering resources to the largely isolated communities damaged by the quake. With temperatures in the region dipping as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit, rescue workers have a short window in which to locate survivors. It was not immediately clear how many residents had been left homeless.

Several aftershocks were felt in the area, including in Nepal. The quake had a magnitude of 7.1, according to the US Geological Survey, though it was measured as 6.8 by the China Earthquake Networks Center.

The nearest city to the earthquake's epicenter was Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet,

with a population of 640,000. Shigatse is home to the vast, centuries-old Tashilhunpo Monastery, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most senior figures in Tibetan Buddhism. State media said no damage to the monastery had been reported so far.

Scenes of destruction were broadcast on state media and shared on social media. A tourist not far from Shigatse who spoke to The New York Times

said she was in her hotel room when the earthquake started shaking her building. She said the electricity went out and that she and a friend had squatted between the beds. When the shaking stopped, they ran out of the building.

The tourist, who only gave her surname, Xu, shared a video showing several single-story brick buildings with collapsed walls. Video posted on Chinese social media showed streets strewn with rubble, cars crushed by fallen bricks, and roads split open by the shifted ground. Xu said she grabbed her down jacket before she ran out.

China's top leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials to minimize casualties and resettle survivors. Chinese authorities deployed 3,400 rescuers and more than 340 medical workers for the search effort, and dis-

patched tents, folding beds, winter coats, and quilts, state media reported.

Rescue efforts could be affected by bottlenecks caused by damaged roads, said Robert Barnett, a professor from SOAS University of London, who has visited the region and described it as looking like "vast moonscape."

"This is harsh, high-altitude land," Barnett said. "The roads are quite few and susceptible to landslides."

That said, Barnett added that there could be new roads connecting some of Dingri County's most remote border villages built in recent years to assert China's sovereignty along its periphery.

The Himalayan region is prone to powerful earthquakes. In 2015, a quake in Nepal with a magnitude of 7.8 killed nearly 9,000 people. In Kathmandu,

Nepal's capital, residents streamed out of their homes in the morning as the earthquake rattled buildings.

At least two people, one in Kathmandu and another one in Sindhupalchowk, a district north of Kathmandu, sustained minor injuries from the quake, according to Nepalese police.

Nepal sent more than 2,500 police officers to assess damage and look for victims.

"Based on the magnitude of the earthquake, there could be some damage in mountains of eastern Nepal," said Lok Bijaya Adhikari, a senior seismologist at Nepal's National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Center.

Most residents from Nepal's high mountain regions such as Everest, Makalu, Rolwaling, and Kanchenjunga have migrated to lowland areas to avoid the extreme cold of winter.

DAILY BRIEFINGFrance marks 10th anniversary of terror attackPARIS — A decade after Islamic terrorists stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in a deadly assault that shook France to its core and ignited a global outcry in defense of freedom of speech, the nation paused on Tuesday to honor the victims and renew its resolve to fight for liberty and democracy.

President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo led solemn tributes at the site of the attack, where 12 people, including some of France's most beloved cartoonists, were killed on Jan. 7, 2015.

Among those remembered was Ahmed Merabet, a police officer who was gunned down on the street while defending the newspaper.

In a poignant ceremony, Macron stood with his wife, Brigitte, alongside former president François Hollande, who had steered France through the aftermath of the attack. Macron joined police officers in laying wreaths of flowers against the wall of the former Charlie Hebdo headquarters in the 11th district and the gathering observed a minute of silence.

Nine workers trapped in mine in northern IndiaGUWAHATI, India — At least nine workers are trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India's northeastern Assam state, officials said Tuesday, as authorities summoned the army to help in the rescue operation.

The miners became trapped on Monday morning in the Umrangso area in Dima Hasao district, about 125 miles south of the state capital, Guwahati.

The workers are feared trapped 300 feet below the ground after water gushed in from a nearby unused mine.

"We are mobilizing resources to rescue them," said Kaushik Rai, a government minister.

Army soldiers and a disaster team used ropes and cranes in the operation. Rescuers found three helmets, some slippers, and a few other items, Rai said.

"The divers have been able to dive into 35 or 40 feet of water inside the mine," he said. "The water level now is estimated at 100 feet."

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the mine appeared to be illegal, and that police had arrested one person thus far.

S. Korea court issues new arrest warrant for YoonSEOUL — South Korea's anticorruption agency said it received a new court warrant on Tuesday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its previous attempt was blocked by the presidential security service last week.

The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which plans to question the embattled president on rebellion allegations over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3, didn't confirm how long the warrant would remain valid. Chief prosecutor Oh Dong-woon refused to answer when asked by lawmakers when the warrant would expire, saying the information is sensitive.

Detention warrants typically last seven days but can be extended to around 10 days. Oh didn't say when investigators planned to make their next attempt to detain Yoon.

The Seoul Western District Court last week had initially issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after he repeatedly defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning.

Israeli strikes kill at least 17 people in Gaza StripMost women, children despite targeting HamasASSOCIATED PRESS

Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza killed at least 17 people late Tuesday, nearly all of them women or children, the territory's Health Ministry and hospital officials said.

Five children were killed as they sheltered together in the same tent, said Ahmed al-Farra, director of the children's ward at nearby Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Their bodies were among the eight children and five women brought to the hospital after strikes on tents, homes, and a vehicle. Two bodies were unidentifiable.

The Israeli military said it targeted militants who had taken part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, without providing evidence. Israel said it took steps to lessen the risk of hurting civilians and blamed Hamas for the civilian casualties.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is raging with no end in sight, although there has reportedly been recent progress in long-running talks aimed at a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip still have hope that Israel's 15-month war with Hamas will end soon.

"What we are living is not a life. Nobody could bear the situation we're experiencing for a single day," said Munawar al-Bik, a displaced woman from Gaza City.

Rescuers and civilians evacuated a victim of an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday.

"We wake up at night to the sounds of men crying, because of the bad situation," al-Bik said. "The situation is unbearable, we have no energy left, we want it to end today."

She spoke to the Associated Press on a dusty road in the southern city of Khan Yunis beside the rubble of a destroyed building. Behind her, a sea of makeshift tents filled with displaced families stretched into the distance.

Muhammad Zaquout, a displaced man from Gaza City, said he's sick of children being killed daily, of the destruction and displacement.

In recent months, families who fled their homes in Gaza have had little access to clean water or enough food to eat,

and they struggle to cope with harsh winter conditions that have killed several babies from hypothermia in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration in its final days is shifting more than \$100 million in military aid from Israel and Egypt to Lebanon as it tries to bolster a cease-fire agreement it helped mediate between Israel and Hezbollah.

In separate notices sent to Congress, the State Department said it was moving \$95 million in military assistance intended for Egypt and \$7.5 million for Israel toward supporting the Lebanese army and its government. The notices were dated Jan. 3 and obtained by the Associated Press on Tuesday.

Most of the money will go to the Lebanese Armed Forces, which have a critical role in standing up the cease-fire that was agreed to in November following an all-out war between Israeli and Hezbollah that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months.

It is intended to help the LAF deploy in the south of the country and supplement the role of the UN peacekeeping mission patrolling the so-called Blue Line, which has separated Israel and Lebanon since the end of a monthlong Israeli-Hezbollah war in 2006.

Both Israel and Hezbollah agreed to pull their forces out of southern Lebanon before the end of January, with com-

pliance to be overseen by the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers.

"US security assistance to the LAF increases its capacity as the country's only legitimate military force and defender of Lebanon's territorial integrity, enables the LAF to prevent potential destabilization from ISIS and other terrorist groups, and enables the LAF to provide security both for the Lebanese people and for US personnel," the State Department said.

Pro-Israel members of Congress and others have in the past complained about any diversion of US assistance to Israel, although it was not immediately clear if there would be objections to such a small amount of shifted money.

At the same time, some of those who have been forceful advocates of Israel and critics of US assistance to the Lebanese military have often complained that it has been infiltrated by Hezbollah. The notices rejected that claim.

"US support to the LAF reinforces the LAF as an important institutional counterweight to Hezbollah, which receives weapons, training, and financial support from Iran," the State Department said. "The LAF continues to be an independent, non-sectarian institution in Lebanon, and is respected across all sectors."

In a third notice, also sent to Congress on Jan. 3, the department said it was going to provide \$15 million to Lebanon's Internal Security Forces to ensure that they become the primary law enforcement entity in the country and assist the LAF in controlling areas in the south.
