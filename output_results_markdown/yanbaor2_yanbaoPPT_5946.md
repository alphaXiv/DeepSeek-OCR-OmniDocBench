<sup>1</sup> In standard shopping basket of fast-moving-consumer goods categories.Source: McKinsey 2016–18 Global Sentiment Survey**Still moving away from the middle**Consumers continue to either trade up or trade down, moving away from midmarket brands. Although globally the trade-up trend is slightly stronger than the trade-down trend, the survey results show vast differences at the country level. Last year, when we saw a marked increase in trade-up behavior among Indian consumers, we predicted a continuation of that trend—driven largely by rapid urbanization, the expansion of modern retail outlets, and premiumization in several CPG categories including beauty products, beverages, and packaged food. Indeed, the latest survey shows that India had the highest trade-up rate, at 25 percent (Exhibit 2).

Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20 percent or higher. Turkish consumers have been active up-traders over the past two years. In the 2016 the latest figure is, unsurprisingly, down slightly, due to tougher economic conditions in Turkey. In China, gains in consumer confidence have led to increases in discretionary spending.<sup>3</sup> A mere 2 percent of Chinese consumers said they traded down.

Source: McKinsey 2018 Global Sentiment Survey**What it means to be thrifty**The most prevalent changes in spending behavior varied greatly by country. Even among consumers who sought to save money, the preferred methods for doing so weren't necessarily the same from one country to the next.

In many countries, including the United States,<sup>4</sup> 39 percent of those who reported a change in buying behavior said they still buy their preferred brands but at stores with lower prices. Compared with 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited for discounts or clipped coupons, suggesting that US bargain hunters, once they've found a cheaper retailer, begin to spend more freely at that retailer. This trend underscores the importance of channel strategy for CPG companies: they need to build a strong presence in channels that are perceived as low priced, such as club stores, discounters, and certain online retailers.
