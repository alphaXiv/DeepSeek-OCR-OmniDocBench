Lucy

Tomorrow is my first day back at school. I want to buy a new schoolbag. First my mum and I go to Xinxin Stationery Shop. I see a big orange bag there. It's 70 yuan. My mum likes it, but I don't like orange. I want a blue bag.

Then we go to Headstart School Shop. There is a blue bag there. It's 110 yuan, but I only have 100 yuan.

Then we go to Kids Right Shop. There is a blue bag there. It's small, but it's 60 yuan. I buy it. I'm very happy.

### Which bag does Lucy buy?
