**Solution: A.**

As shown in the figure,  $\Delta ABC$  is similar to  $\Delta BDC$ .

$$\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BC}{DC} \Rightarrow \frac{12}{5} = \frac{5}{DC}$$

$$DC = 25/12 = 2\frac{1}{12}.$$

**Example 7.** In the following diagram (not necessarily to scale),  $\angle ABE = \angle ADC$ ,

 $AE = 6$ ,  $BC = 2$ ,  $BE = 3$ , and  $CD = 5$ .  $AB + DE$  is equal to

A.  $46/3$  B.  $112/3$  C.  $13/2$  D. 20 E. none of these

**Solution: A.**

We separate two triangles and label each segments as shown in the figure.

We know that  $\Delta ABE = \Delta ADC$ .

$$\text{So } \frac{5}{3} = \frac{x+2}{6} \Rightarrow x = 8.$$

$$\text{So } \frac{5}{3} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y}{8} \Rightarrow y = \frac{40}{3}.$$

$$AB + DE = 8 + y = \frac{40}{3} - 6 = \frac{46}{3}.$$
