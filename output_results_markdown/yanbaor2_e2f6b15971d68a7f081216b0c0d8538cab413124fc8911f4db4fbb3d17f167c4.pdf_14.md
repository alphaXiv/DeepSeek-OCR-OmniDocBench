Chinese investors will start to understand risk-return, and the investment time horizons that come with them. There is a shift, albeit a slow one, towards more long-term, solutions-based investing, and foreign managers should play a key role in this movement.

Leading foreign managers are investing substantial resources in educating retail investors in a vast variety of investment topics, from retirement to ESG, through leading digital channels

such as WeChat and Ant Financial. Foreign managers should leverage such digital channels to drive investor education, but can also consider innovative new channels, such as providing financial literacy education in universities and high schools. Financial literacy remains low worldwide, but China is known for leapfrogging other countries when it commits to an idea. Being a part of the conversation will give foreign managers a platform to build their brands.
