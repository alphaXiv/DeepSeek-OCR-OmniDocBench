Generally, this is what we could do:

Area of 1 rectangle  $\approx f(x) \times h$ 

 $f(x)$ 

 $h$ 

Area of all the rectangles  $\approx \sum f(x) \times h$ 

Actual area under the curve  $= \lim_{h \to 0} \sum f(x) \times h$ 

which is written as  $\int f(x) dx$ 

(but evaluating this limit is incredibly complicated)
