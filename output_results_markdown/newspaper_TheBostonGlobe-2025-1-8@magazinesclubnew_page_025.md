# Doherty's special path

## Hingham captain shows MIAA way to college play

By Mike Puzzanghera

GLOBE CORRESPONDENT

Caroline Doherty is evidence that there's no set path to a dream.

Hingham's star senior forward — committed to play at Holy Cross after a post-grad year — has done it all while playing for the town she grew up in. She's the school's all-time leading scorer, a two-time Patriot League MVP, and one of the state's most talented players.

She takes immense pride in the career she's built at Hingham.

"Personally, I don't think it matters where you go to school, as long as you put the work in," Doherty said. "I get to play with my sister [Brenna] and all the people I grew up playing with. I think the 'public pride' part of it is honestly my favorite part."

"I play in front of the little girls who all look up to all of us. That's probably the best part of it, too."

Doherty leads a Harborwomen team, ranked No. 1 in the Globe's Top 20, that has eyes on its first title since 2011. They're off to a 6-0-0 start, with Doherty scoring 14 goals.

"She could probably go out here in some of these games and score 17 goals," third-year Hingham coach Courtney Turner said. "But she's looking for her teammates after the first one or two. I think that says more about her character than her scoring."

Doherty burst onto the scene as a freshman, then exploded for 48 goals and 28 assists as a sophomore. After another 36 points a year ago and 17 to start the new season, she's at 190 for her career. Of those, 126 are goals — the 122nd of which set the Hingham record on Christmas Eve, assisted by her sister.

It's easy to see the talent Doherty possesses. She can take out defenders with her stick-handling and snipe a corner like clockwork.

But it's her work ethic and drive to be better that have gotten her here. Monday afternoon, she takes the ice more than 30 minutes before Hingham's practice begins, getting extra work in with fellow captain **Addy Garrity**.

"She puts in a lot of work behind the scenes that allows her to be a goal scorer," Turner said. "She also just goes to the gym all the time. Her shot is a testament to how much work she puts in at the gym."

With her talent, Doherty could have easily taken the prep school route. But in sticking with the Harborwomen, she displayed that talent and hard work — not the school on your sweater — make a college career possible.

"My first year here, we had the prep school discussion," Turner said. "She wanted to stay here. I'm very happy she did, and I know she'll have these friends for life."

Doherty made a switch at the club level this year, moving to the Massachusetts Spithires — ranked as one of the top programs not just in the state, but in the country. The move was all Doherty's doing — she reached out to coach **Joe Hubbig** to set up an opportunity, and even though the Spithires had a full roster, she impressed enough to make the team. At their first tournament of the year over Labor Day weekend, Hubbig said every college coach he talked to wanted to know about her.

Of the 19 players on the roster, she's the only one at an MIAA program. Despite this, she finished the fall season as the team's top scorer with nine goals.

| 20. | Canton              | 3-2-1 | 15   |

"She's a rare athlete that has a natural ability to keep focus and discipline," Hubbig said. "She wants it, and that's what's been able to make her successful."

"Someday, she's going to look back at this and say, 'I'm glad I finished it out at Hingham,' because it's a pretty special thing that she's doing."

Doherty committed to Holy Cross in September and will join up with the Crusaders in fall 2026 to play for coach **Katie Lachapelle** at an up-and-coming program in Hockey East. She'll join Spitfires teammate **Violet Carroll** (Williston Northampton) in Worcester. (She's still undecided where she will skate next season.)

"I fell in love with the school itself, which I think is bigger than the hockey part," Doherty said. "When the hockey part fell into place, it was just a perfect fit."

That's all in the future — at the moment, the 5-foot-6-inch sniper is focused on enjoying time with her friends in her hometown.

"I really just want to take in these last few months," Doherty said. "Playing with my sister, all the seniors I won't get to play with again, and all these girls. I just want to have fun and enjoy it."

## Ice chips

■ After years of preaching a defense-first mentality, King Philip coach **Ken Assad** is finally seeing his vision come to fruition.

Since dropping their season opener to Smithfield (R.I.), the Warriors have won five in a row, and they have given up one goal or less in four of the five victories.

"For the last three years, I've been focusing on team defense, and it really hasn't clicked until this year," Assad said. "These girls get what team defense is all about."

King Philip's new identity is led by sophomore **Calleigh Brady**, junior **Grace Leehan-Allen**, and freshman **Laury O'Shea** on the blue line, and junior net-minder **Kiki Lynch**, who has allowed just six goals through six games.

After winning three consecutive games by one-goal margins, the Warriors secured their most impressive victory to date in a 3-0 win over No. 20 Canton on Saturday.

"It's tribute to all the back-checkers, defenders, goaltending, you name it, they're all just coming together and playing as one," Assad said. "It's a different brand of hockey that they're putting out this year."

■ Canton got off to a 3-0-1 start under first-year coach **Marissa Massaro**, prior to dropping games this week to King Philip and Notre Dame (Hingham).

One key weapon for the

Bulldogs is sophomore forward **Lauren Raffetto** — who, when she is not playing top-line minutes for the girls' hockey team, is one of the state's best cross-country runners.

Raffetto finished 13th in the MIAA Division 2 Meet of Champions race in November, and she also owns Canton's 5K school record time by 45 seconds.

Raffetto scored a goal in Canton's 3-1 victory over No. 12 Nauset on Thursday, and her cross-country skill-set has proven to be an asset.

"Her endurance is incredible. She can play as many minutes as I possibly need," Massaro said. "I think at one point [against Nauset], she played three minutes straight and got off the ice and wasn't tired. She's skilled and she's aggressive in the best way possible, and she can go and go and never worry about running out of steam."
