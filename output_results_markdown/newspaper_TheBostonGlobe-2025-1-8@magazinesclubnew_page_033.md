10 new restaurants to try in the new year►RESTAURANTSContinued from Page G1pork belly bao buns and tacos, miso eggplant, and grilled steak with chimichurri sauce. Chef Jesus Preciado's menu draws from Asia and Latin America (including his native Colombia). On the cocktail list, find drinks like Beet the Heat (made with spicy pisco and beet syrup) and Amarillo Passion (in which tequila meets yuzu liqueur, passion fruit syrup, and the aji amarillo chile).

647 Tremont St., South End, Boston, 617-286-2333, [www.desnudacocina.com](#). Smaller plates \$6-\$18, larger plates \$18-\$32, cocktails \$14-\$17.

KaiaThe latest from Xenia Greek Hospitality, which brought us Bar Vlahia, Kras, and more. This time, culinary director Brendan Pelley and team whisk diners to the Aegean (with a South End mind-set) via dishes like sea bream crudo with fermented squash broth; barley toasts with beets, pears, and vegan feta; black truffle spanakopita; and grilled whole fish. The wine list is devoted solely to selections from the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean islands.

370 Harrison Ave., South End, Boston, 617-514-0700, [www.kaiasouthend.com](#). Dishes \$16-\$44.

Masons SteakhouseHere's what happens when a group of powerhouse South Shore culinary pros (including Jimmy Liang of JP Fuji Group and Kevin Long of Tosca) join forces. This swank Quincy steakhouse is located in a former Masonic temple and serves up lobster bisque, oysters Rockefeller, pappardelle bolognese, salmon with spiced cauliflower — and, of course, beautiful steaks. The also-beautiful, creative desserts are from pastry chef and Masons co-owner Robert Gonzalez, who is behind Quincy's Niveaux Pâtisserie. In a landscape (increasingly) stocked with steakhouses, it is nice to see a new one open with local ownership.

1170 Hancock St., Quincy, 617-689-8818, [www.masonssteakhouse.com](#). Appetizers \$14-\$32, entrees \$29-\$45, steaks \$52-\$160, sides \$6-\$14, desserts \$12-\$19.

McGonagle's PubIf you appreciate the Dubliner, bringing excellent fish and chips and Irish hospitality to downtown Boston, you will likely feel the same about McGonagle's in Dorchester. Pigs in a blanket made with sausage from Adams Village

MICHAEL DISKINDesnuda Cocina & Bar (above) and Russ & Mimi's (right) are among the many exciting restaurants arriving on the scene.

Butcher Shop, smoky seafood chowder with Irish soda bread, shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, and other pub favorites are here, along with wood-fired pizza, brunch (yes, full Irish breakfast), and festive cocktails. Or just drop in for live music and a proper pint of Guinness.

367 Neponset Ave., Dorchester, 617-514-4689, [www.mcgonagles.com](#). Appetizers \$8-\$16, pizza \$18-\$19, entrees \$18-\$34.

Mikiya Wagyu Shabu HouseIf you're starving, cold, and enjoy wagyu beef, Mikiya is calling you. This Chinatown restaurant serves all-you-can-eat wagyu hot pot at a variety of price points; you have 90 minutes to cook a variety of cuts in the broths of your choosing, while eating specialty dishes such as sweet shrimp sashimi and wagyu bone marrow, plus fruit and ice cream for dessert. Mikiya is a project from Chubby Group, whose Kevin Liu is also behind Matsunori Handroll Bar.

JONATHAN WIGGS/GLOBE STAFFWagyu sets \$45-\$98 (less with annual membership; free or half-price for kids).

Russ & Mimi'sNamed for the parents of owner Kelly Walsh (Sweet Cheeks, Tiger Mama), this Roslindale market offers wine (it's in the former Solera space), olive oil, hot sauce, and other must-haves. But it's the food that has the neighborhood most

excited. Start the morning with egg wraps, overnight oats, cheesy grits, and cumin-spiced black beans with fried egg, salsa, and avocado; then segue into the "Cubano, veggie grinder, muffuletta, charred broccoli Caesar" part of the day. Chef Stephen Marcuarelle (the Nautilus Pier 4, Tres Gatos) helped design the menu.

16 Birch St., Roslindale, 617-833-6950, [www.russandmimis.com](#). Dishes

\$8-\$16.Soul on ShawmutRoxbury-raised chef Aadam Abdul-Musawwir began serving prepared meals and pop-up dinners as Aadam's Halal Meals. Now, he and two siblings have opened Soul on Shawmut to feed their community. Lightly updated soul food classics are on the menu, along with Buffalo chicken egg rolls, grilled cheese burgers, and more. Fried chicken with Old Bay honey, smoked mac and cheese, slow-cooked collard greens with sauteed cabbage, sweet potato cheesecake, and hibiscus watermelon juice sounds pretty unbeatable for dinner tonight.

722A Shawmut Ave., Roxbury, 617-238-7525, [www.soulonshawmut.com](#). Sandwiches \$10-\$18, fried chicken \$7-\$18, sides \$5, desserts \$3-\$6.

Standard ItalianWhere others fail, there is Italian food. Standard Italian, in the Eastern Standard complex looming over Fenway, replaces the former All That Fish + Oyster, and it's a smart move. Lasagna bolognese, porchetta, and espresso martinis could just get us all through the winter. Culinary director Brian Rae is in his element, having previously worked at Coppa, Faccia a Faccia, and Rialto.

771 Beacon St., Fenway, Boston, 857-305-3095, [www.standarditalian.com](#). Appetizers \$5-\$20, entrees \$28-\$42, desserts \$9-\$12.

ZuritoIt's named for the small glass of beer that often accompanies pintxos, the Basque take on tapas, and this Beacon Hill restaurant serves up plenty: Gildas, skewers of anchovies, peppers, and olives; griddled shrimp with garlic and chile oil; mini croissants stuffed with jamon iberico; squid ink risotto. Cocktails such as the sherry-based Perfect Bamboo and fizzy glasses of tzakolina are perfect accompaniments. Zurito, located in the longtime Bin 26 space, is run by chef Jamie Bissonnette, Babak Bina, and Andy Cartin of BCB3 Hospitality, also behind Somaek, Temple Records, and Sushi @ Temple Records.

26 Charles St., Beacon Hill, Boston, 857-305-3177, [www.zuritoboston.com](#). Pintxos \$4.50-\$12, raciones \$9-\$19, platos especiales \$17-\$125.

Restaurants continue to innovate in mocktail realm►MOCKTAILSContinued from Page G1there are a plethora of base options that can really make a non-alcoholic drink look and taste nearly identical to an alcoholic one," says Joel Atlas, a mixologist at the Avery Bar at the Ritz-Carlton, Boston. "The bloom of options has really picked up in the last year and a half to two years."

"[Mocktails] are certainly marketed more in January, but the truth of it all is that the non-alcoholic or low-ABV consumer is sustaining through much of the year," says Nick Moniz, general manager of Banners Kitchen and Tap and Hub Hall.

"For so long, a mocktail was limited to just a soda water and cranberry, or a sugar bomb of juices made with whatever was lying around behind the bar. Consumers wanted and deserved more than that."

In that spirit — or lack thereof — here are 12 mocktail destinations to try every month of the year.

Abe & Louie'sThe storied steakhouse offers a \$14 mocktail menu. Their New Year, New Spritz combines zero-proof sparkling Cava with non-alcoholic tequila, cucumber, lime, and mint for a spa-like pour. Good for: expense-account dining. 793 Boylston St., Boston, 617-536-6300

AlcoveIn the West End, cozy Alcove does an \$11 mocktail menu with unusual offerings like Papi's Punch, with grilled pineapple, syrup and Athletic Free Wave nonalcoholic IPA, or a Queen's Bee, made with the herbaceous nonalcoholic spirit Garden 108 and honey. Good for: T.D. Garden pre-game hangouts. 50 Lovejoy Wharf, Boston, 617-248-0050

Avery Bar at the Ritz-Carlton, BostonThis might be one of Boston's most classic of cocktail refuges, but it also caters to modern mores. A nonalcoholic Old-Fash-

Public Garden, and it serves far more than wine. A \$10 mocktail menu has spins on classics like tiki punch, a cosmopolitan, and a spicy citrus mule. Good for: dinner with the parents. 272 Boylston St., Boston, 617-279-8000

CapoThis South Boston red-sauce lair might seem like the type of spot to throw back icy martinis (they do host Sinatra Sundays, after all) paired with big plates of rigatoni Bolognese, but they also have warming \$9 mocktails, like the Far From the Tree, with toasty apple cider, cardamom, allspice, thyme, and egg whites. In addition to catering to non-drinkers, they accommodate a range of palates, with gluten-free pasta on request. Good for: a night out with a group. 443 West Broadway, Boston, 617-993-8080

Hunter'sThis is your spot for biscuits, fried chicken, mac-and-cheese ... in other words, resolution-breaking meals. That said: This dark, cozy bar and kitchen also pays attention to mocktails, which are a relative steal at \$6. Wash down your honey-butter,

bacon-topped cornbread with refreshing house-made watermelon juice and soda. Good for: comfort food. 110 Dorchester St., Boston, 617-221-4200

La PadronaStylish, swanky, and with a stellar chef attached (Jody Adams), this Italian destination inside Raffles Boston is the ultimate in special-occasion dining: The silken tagliatelle alone is worth the trip up that grand staircase. Sure, there's also an extensive martini menu, but spirit-free drinks also get proper due. A nonalcoholic tangerine margarita with spirit-free tequila and lime is worth toasting. Not quite

ready to abstain? There's also an extensive low-ABV list featuring treats like a Lambrusco Cobbler, made with black currant and berries. Good for: a celebratory splurge. 38 Trinity Place, Boston, 617-221-4200

Midnight MorningThis cheery Roslindale bistro specializes in comfort food: sausage dip, mushroom-and-cream-cheese wontons, burgers, and fried pickles. It makes nondrinkers feel comfy, too, with a nice \$12 selection of zero-proof drinks: The Regret Nothing, with nonalcoholic Ritual Proof tequila, jalapeño, and lime, is true to its name. Good for: a laid-back weekend dinner. 14 Birch St., Roslindale, 617-390-5830

Trina's Starlite LoungeThis industry hangout takes dive-bar food to another level — they pioneered dressed-up tater tots and mac-and-cheese before it was fashionable. Here, \$5 cans of Miller High Life share real estate with cheeky mocktails like the Phony Negroni, a nonalcoholic version of the classic, and Island Life, Baby, made with a booze-free, floral Flüe-Botanic Blend. Good for: dive-bar-dining without the buzz. 3 Beacon St., Somerville, 617-576-0006

Tuscan BrandsThis Italian mini-empire

serves reliable food in convenient locations and a thoughtfully curated list of spirit-free sips, like a Tea Party with coconut water, chai tea, and brown sugar, and the Co-So-Politan, made with honey water, cranberry, rooibos tea, and lime. Beverage director Jose Luis Betancur also has a fondness for tart Italian sodas like Chinotto or Stappi Gasosa. Good for: pleasing a crowd (or kids). 64 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, 617-303-7300, and other locations

Woods Hill Pier 4Owner Kristin Canty is known for serving pasture-

raised meat and other fresh, healthy ingredients from her Farm at Woods Hill in New Hampshire at this waterfront branch of her West Concord original. Mocktails (most are \$8 and up) also showcase ingredients and garnishes from her farm. Sip a Fly-Tai, made with pineapple, orange, lime, almond orgeat, and ginger ale. Good for: entertaining out-of-towners. 300 Pier 4 Blvd., Boston, 617-981-4577
