DAN MACMEDAN/USA TODAYMAKING WAVESARIANA GRANDEFans of Ariana Grande were up in arms after the actress and singer was asked on the Golden Globes red carpet whether her grandmother was "still alive." An Access Hollywood reporter quizzed the "Wicked" star about whom she called first after her nomination for the Jan. 5 awards ceremony. When she said her mom, the reporter asked, "grandmother still alive?" Grande didn't appear offended by the question, but fans online called it "risky" and "sick."

A role like László Tóth is "very meaningful and very rare," says "The Brutalist" star Adrien Brody. PROVIDED BY A24Adrien Brody draws on family's sacrifice to find truth in 'Brutalist'Patrick Ryan USA TODAYNEW YORK – At 29, Adrien Brody became the youngest man ever to win the best actor Oscar for the 2002 Holocaust drama "The Pianist." • More than two decades later, he could very well clinch his second gold statue for "The Brutalist" (in select theaters now), playing a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant in Brady Corbet's 3½-hour epic. The character, a battered architect named László Tóth, is immensely personal to Brody, 51, whose father is Polish Jewish and mother is Hungarian. As a girl, she fled Budapest with her parents during the Hungarian Revolution, settling in New York in 1958. • "Nothing really feels fictional about this film, even though it is a fictional story," says Brody, sipping tea on a rainy December afternoon. "It's inside me; it's deeply rooted in truth. Just last night, my mom sent me a whole slew of images: some from 'The Pianist,' some from my grandfather, some with my father holding me as a boy. It's all there: all the lives that I've lived and chapters in my life."

Brody recalls 'painful' experience of making 'The Pianist'"Brutalist" spans several decades, beginning as László lands in Pennsylvania after World War II, where he shovels coal and bunks in his cousin's storage closet. Once a celebrated architect in his native Hungary, he eventually is scooped up by a wealthy industrialist (Guy Pearce), who commissions László to design and build an exorbitant community center. But even

as he and his wife Erzsébet (Felicity Jones) attempt to forge a new life, they are constantly exploited and reminded they are "other."

Brody was struck by the "complexity" and "nuance" of Corbet's script, which he co-wrote with his partner, filmmaker Mona Fastvold.

"It's unfortunately taken me decades to find something like this," Brody says. "It's such an ambitious thing. But also, it instantly tapped into my mother and grandparents' struggle of coming to

America. Even in spite of assimilating and becoming Americans, you're still a foreigner."

For Corbet, casting Brody was "very clear because of his family history," the director says. What's more, "he just felt so incredibly emotionally available; so graceful and so pained. I mean, he really just wore his heart on his sleeve."

With his angular features and searching eyes, Brody has been a

Yes, eight years after the network canceled his last sitcom of the same genre, "Last Man Standing" (later picked up by Fox, where it ran until 2021), Allen is back on ABC. And now, instead of playing an overwrought patriarch working at an outdoorsy company battling with a wife and daughters, he's an overwrought patriarch who owns a classic car shop and battles one daughter, played by Kat Dennings. So different!

"Gears" (Wednesdays, 8 EST/PST, ★★★★), created by Mike Scully and Julie Thacker-Scully ("The Simpsons"), is neither original nor exciting; It's an unchallenging and not very funny package of generational stereotypes and grating banter between Allen and Dennings. The two episodes made available for review feature dialogue so bland it could have been written by AI. They lack excitement in any way, but are not so achingly terrible they offend the senses. And consider-

ing both Allen's track record and the recent spate of deeply disappointing multi-camera sitcoms on broadcast TV, that's actually an achievement. Expectations are everything.

This series finds Allen as Matt, a wid-

ower, everyman and possessor of Fox News opinions. His quiet life is turned upside down (a sitcom must) when his daughter Riley (Dennings) moves back
