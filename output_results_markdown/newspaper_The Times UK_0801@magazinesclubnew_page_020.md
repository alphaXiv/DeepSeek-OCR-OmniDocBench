CommentWhy Trump's Greenland pitch makes good senseIn US hands, the minerals and seaboard of the world's biggest island would strengthen the West

@ROGERBOYESIf there is still a globe in the Oval Office after January 20, President Trump will no doubt give it a spin and wonder again about the huge, frozen landmass within shooting distance of American cities. Greenland — two million square kilometres of it — is in geopolitical contention again.

China craves its rare earth minerals. It imagines the world's biggest island becoming part of its Polar Silk Road, a crucial stopover for its vessels as they exploit the melting Arctic ice to boost trade between Asia and the West.

Trump has an answer to that: he wants to buy the place. Rebuffed by Denmark and Greenlanders in his first term, he is ready for a second go. Donald Trump Jr has just touched down in Greenland to start the ball rolling. Two questions, then. Will he succeed? And what changes if the United States, literally, grows?

His first attempt was treated as a joke, an act of flamboyant Trumpian overreach. Greenland's prime minister — it has home rule while remaining part of Denmark, which runs its foreign policy and hands out subsidies — declared the island was not for sale. But Trump understood this as a bargaining manoeuvre and never gave up on the idea. After all, Harry Truman considered buying

Greenland after the Second World War as a way of cutting off a potential Soviet attack. The purchase never went ahead but America was allowed to build a network of bases, including Thule, which became a key early missile warning station. That gave both Washington and the Greenlanders a sense of security.

The end of the Cold War in the 1990s thinned the American presence. Greenlanders missed the jobs and the dollars but they did not miss the Americans: the thunder of aircraft, the pregnant girls and the occasional scare, such as in January 1968 when a B-52 carrying four hydrogen bombs caught fire and plunged into sea ice just outside

Understandably, the Danes do not want to lose face or landThule. The Danes furiously demanded that all the sunken unexploded bombs and the irradiated ice be packed up and flown back to the US for dismantling. If not, Denmark would shut down the Thule base. The US grudgingly agreed.

The world, however, has changed for the US, Denmark and the Greenlanders. Since Trump won the election, China has been flexing its muscles. It has conducted its largest naval exercises in decades, launched the world's biggest amphibious warship, been accused of sabotaging undersea cables in Asia and Europe and hacking the US Treasury, unveiled four new advanced aircraft, rehearsed a naval blockade near

Japanese islands for the first time and intensified espionage activity in the West. The point? To help Beijing negotiate with Trump from a position of strength.

To counter this, Trump needs to evolve an approach of his own. The Greenland ploy, coupled perhaps with attempts to regain control of the sensitive Panama Canal, represents a kind of recognition by Trump that the global climate really is changing the strategic environment. After all, a melting Arctic means easier mining access to nickel and cobalt, essential for batteries. And it will break western dependency on China for the rare metals needed for microchips and sonar systems. That represents a learning process from the days of Trump 1.0.

Expanding America might seem like a vanity project — the acquisition of Greenland would be almost as significant as the Louisiana purchase of 1803. It would certainly be a sign of a confident superpower. But if not negotiated with sensitivity, it could put him in the same basket as land-grabbing Vladimir Putin's pursuit of a New Russia.

At the moment, he seems to be trusting in his powers of persuasion over Greenland's puny population of 56,000. An old signpost at Kangerlussuaq airport points to Copenhagen (4 hours 15 minutes' flying time), North Pole (3 hours and 15 minutes) and New York (4 hours).

Trump may bet he can make the whole island more prosperous with US investment, make a shopping weekend in New York as feasible as it became for the Icelandic middle

class. Denmark subsidises Greenland but locals say it comes with too much thinly disguised interference. Above all, there is deep resentment about the colonial haughtiness of the Danes. The latest spat is about forced contraception that was pushed on teenage native Greenlanders in the 1970s by the Danish authorities.

Denmark, understandably, does not want to lose face or land. King Frederik has recently adjusted the royal coat of arms to include a much larger polar bear representing Greenland. Islanders regarded this as a bit of trolling.

Trump could be placing his bets on an independence referendum being held in April. If the Greenlanders vote for it persuasively, it might open another debate: whether the island, with more power to determine its foreign policy, could in some way affiliate with the US.

What a signal to China! Maga made flesh. And yet there will be some around Trump who may caution him that facilitating a split with a Nato ally is not a good look. It is, after all, a longstanding ambition of Putin to rule by splitting the western alliance.

A more rational goal for the America-expanders may be to reach an arrangement with Greenland and Denmark that allows the US to use those western Greenland territories closest to the US eastern seaboard as a security cushion. Prosperity for Greenlanders, enhanced security for the US and a partial loss of sovereignty for Denmark offset by the offer of a deeper relationship with Washington. A grand bargain?

We should recall what prompted the Jay inquiryHarvey ProctorProfessor Alexis Jay, chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), declared her dismay yesterday at the "politicisation of child sexual abuse". While her observation is timely, it begs a fundamental question: where was her criticism of the politicians who relentlessly drove this inquiry into existence for their own ends?

The origins of the IICSA are rooted not in impartial concern for justice but in the politically charged fervour whipped up by individuals such as Tom Watson, John Mann and Zac Goldsmith, three figures now elevated to the House of Lords. Each used their position to push falsehoods and fuel a national moral panic under the guise of exposing a so-called "VIP paedophile network".

Watson, in particular, stands out for his questionable use of his parliamentary privilege. He peddled the lies of Carl Beech, a convicted fraudster and paedophile whose lurid claims became the backbone of Operation Midland. Watson's baseless accusations tarnished the reputations of dedicated public servants including the D-Day hero Lord Bramall, falsely accusing him of heinous crimes such as child abuse.

Theresa May, as home secretary, irresponsibly echoed this hysteria by stating in November 2014 that Operation Midland was merely "the tip of the iceberg". It wasn't even the tip of an ice cube.

Let us not forget that the IICSA was a product of political pressure, launched not to investigate grooming gangs nor to address systemic failures but to appease MPs hoping to make political capital by pushing for answers to the fabricated claims of abuse at the hands of VIPs. When Operation Midland collapsed, the inquiry scrambled to pivot its focus elsewhere, including grooming gangs — an area in which its work was neither comprehensive nor free from political undertones.

If Jay is genuinely concerned about politicisation, she must confront the uncomfortable reality that her inquiry, too, was born from it. While the IICSA may have brought some clarity, it left key questions unanswered: chiefly, why Pakistani grooming gangs were allowed to operate with impunity for so long.

Communities in northern towns and cities deserve justice for the systemic failures that enabled such horrors. Yet these same failures remain largely unexamined. It is time to focus on meaningful reforms as well as focused and truly independent inquiries, not on perpetuating the culture of suspicion and slander that brought about this inquiry in the first place.

Tom Whipple NotebookIgnorance of history was bliss for Bill, Ted and me*Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure* is, to my mind, a most bodacious film, which was why I feared showing it to my children. A joy of parenting is introducing your kids to things you love. A sadness is seeing them endure the things you love out of politeness.

Had it aged badly? Nervously, I watched their reaction.

A primer, for those whose cultural education inexplicably passed over this 1980s classic: for the sake of the future of the universe, for reasons that really don't matter, the teenage Ted has to pass his school history project. To achieve this, time travellers from the future help him meet key figures from the past — Genghis Khan, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Socrates, Joan of Arc.

Would my sons consider this conceit — a ludicrous worry, I know — contrived? Worse, as we lament the shallowness of history

curriculums, would they understand the references?

I needn't have worried. What I realised was, far from my children not understanding, it was me who hadn't. Nine-year-old me enjoyed the slapstick of Genghis Khan wrecking a sports shop. I hadn't known, however, who Genghis Khan was, even with the narrative exposition. "This is a dude who, 700 years ago, totally ravaged China," explained Ted, "and who, two hours ago, totally ravaged Oshman's Sporting Goods."

My former self laughed at a short Frenchman cheating at bowling then planning an invasion of Russia. But if you had asked me who Napoleon was? Not a clue.

My own children had no such confusion. The reason? Another TV show, *Horrible Histories*. Thanks to the CBBC series, they have better basic history knowledge than I do today. So do their friends.

Imagine if one of Michael Gove's education reforms had produced this level of improvement in subject knowledge. Education ministers would travel from around the world to copy it.

Now I hear that *Horrible Science* is coming to TV. It will be, as Ted would say, most triumphant.

Clean thinkingDuring my morning shower I might just have resolved, for myself at least, that centuries-old philosophical battle: whether or not free will is an illusion.

Inside the shower, the world is nice. Outside, it is cold and, in my house, beset by children. So,

leaving it is hard. What I find interesting — and I have spoken to others who find the same — is that leaving happens outside of my conscious thought. I turn off the shower and, only a half-second later, do I realise, with regret, that I have done so.

I would think I was mad if this didn't accord with some — debated — neuroscience. In the 1980s a scientist named Benjamin Libet asked people to flex a finger. He also asked them to closely watch a clock and remember the time they made the decision to do so. He showed, using

probes in their brains, that the motor cortex started preparing for the movement before the person claimed to have told it to do so. Conscious control was an illusion.

Maybe, in our cacophony of thoughts, this is missed. Perhaps it is only with simple decisions, such as switching off a shower or flicking a finger, our brain can glimpse the shocking truth about itself: it is nothing more than chemistry.

Everyday miracleEach year, at least once, our family try to see the starlings murmurate. In a damp, grey wetland at a damp, grey dusk, we wait. There is always a moment I think it won't happen. Then, in small groups, they arrive. Soon there is a boiling blob of thousands, shifting and morphing. It is otherworldly, a fluttering, black collective against skeletal trees. For 20 minutes they dance, then, as one, their wings beat with the noise of a sudden storm and they drop into the reeds to sleep.

It feels like the sort of spectacle that happens in remote places frequented by the BBC natural history unit. But this isn't the Serengeti. It's here, every winter, in Theale or Twyford or somewhere near you. And most evenings we go, we're the only ones watching.
