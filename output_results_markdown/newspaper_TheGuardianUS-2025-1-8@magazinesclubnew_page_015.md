"Competitions create better competitors. In politics, leadership campaigns make for better general

election campaign teams. They train people, test ideas, build resilience," he wrote.

Butts said the party's future was at risk if it held a limited race bound by tight rules. "If Liberals arrogate that right to a few hundred people in Ottawa, I hope they're alert to the risk that they could be selecting the party's

last leader."

A poll by the Angus Reid Institute on Friday, before Trudeau's announcement, found Carney was in second place among candidates likely to replace Trudeau as Liberal leader. The former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation last month increased calls for Trudeau to go, was

top.

If he were to win the leadership race, Carney would be in the unusual situation of becoming prime minister without holding a seat in the House of Commons. Party leaders are not required to be members of parliament when they win, but convention requires they run for a seat as quickly

as possible. It took Jagmeet Singh 16 months to become an MP after winning the leadership of the New Democratic party.

With a spring election widely expected, the new Liberal leader will only hold the post of prime minister for a handful of months before the country votes.

# Jon Stewart on Harris presiding over election certification: 'Like attending your own funeral'

## Guardian staff

Late-night hosts talk the fourth anniversary of the 6 January insurrection and an uneventful transfer of power in Washington.

### Jon Stewart

"What a historic day in Washington DC," said Jon Stewart, returning to the Daily Show on 6 January 2025. "Once again, a blanket of angry white is descending on the Capitol," he added over a picture of the Capitol covered in snow. "This white, oddly enough, not as disruptive. It did snarl traffic, but a lot less bear spray and Confederate flags."

The host acknowledged the date, a day "that traditionally we now pretend that we knew was a big deal, in terms of certifying the elections", Stewart laughed. "Be honest - before that insurrection, you had no fucking idea that was there."

Congress did certify Donald Trump's victory on Monday. The "ultimate indignity" of the affair was that as the vice-president, Trump's opponent in the election, Kamala Harris, served as the "master of ceremonies".

"That's got to sting," said Stewart. "It's like attending your own funeral, and even the mourners are like, 'Woo-hoo!' I can't imagine anything that would be more uncomfortable than standing there while the crowd applauds your opponent."

There were, at least, also loud

cheers for when she announced her (losing) total of votes.

"Wait! That sounded louder," Stewart joked. "There is a lot of joy in that room. I think she can still win this thing! She just needs them to find 130,000 votes in Georgia! And then some in Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe Wisconsin."

Ultimately, "the certification ceremony that we all look forward to every four years, since I was little, went off

without a hitch," he concluded. "Because it's amazing how smoothly our democracy works when you don't act like a little bitch when you lose."

### Stephen Colbert

"It's good to be back," said Stephen Colbert on Monday's Late Show. It was 6 January, and Congress had just certified Donald Trump's electoral victory. "Yes, I used to feel things, too," said Colbert as the crowd booed.

"And the striking thing about this

time was how normal it was again," he continued. "There was no riot. No one broke a window with their beard."

"I'm not sure what there is to say about January 6 at this point," he added. "We all saw what happened. Trump lost. He said he didn't. A bunch of cowardly Republicans backed him up. They all whipped up a mob which stormed the Capitol and beat police with flag poles, trying to overturn our democracy. This launched the largest

criminal investigation in our nation's history. Nearly 1,600 of the rioters faced judicial inquiry, 1,000 of which have already been to trial or pleaded guilty. Out of all of them, two have been acquitted."

In sum: "The results are in: it was bad." Or as Trump put it in an interview: "It was a day of love."

"Yes, love was in the air. Also, bear spray," said Colbert. "And by reinstalling Donald Trump, we are stepping right through the Orwellian looking-glass. With Trump, hate is love, violence is peace, nugget is food."

### Jimmy Kimmel

And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also acknowledged the anniversary of the insurrection. "It's actually very convenient that Eric's birthday is on January 6. That way Trump only has to remember the two biggest mistakes that he made on one day," he joked.

"I can't believe it's been four years," he added. "It seems like only yesterday Nancy Pelosi was hosing feces off her desk at the Capitol." This time, at least, it "went off without Ted Cruz having to hide in a broom closet".

Kimmel touched on the "master-stroke of irony" that was Harris presiding over the certification of Trump's victory. "That is cruel and unusual. It's like making your ex DJ your wedding to your new [fiance]," he joked.

"You notice how uneventful it was today?" he added. "The Democrats lost, and they accepted they lost."

# Jimmy Carter's remains arrive in Washington DC for state funeral rites

## Associated Press

Nearly 44 years after Jimmy Carter left the country's capital in humbling defeat, the 39th president returned to Washington DC for three days of state funeral rites starting on Tuesday.

Carter's remains, which had been lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center since Saturday, left the Atlanta campus on Tuesday morning, accompanied by his children and extended family. Special Air Mission 39 departed Dobbins air reserve base north of Atlanta and arrived at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. A motorcade carried the casket into Washington for a final journey to the Capitol,

where members of Congress will pay their respects.

In Georgia, eight military pallbearers held Carter's casket as cannons fired on the tarmac nearby. They carried it to a vehicle that lifted it to the passenger compartment of the aircraft, the blue and white Boeing 747 variant that is known as Air Force One when the sitting president is on board. Carter never traveled as president on the jet, which first flew as Air Force One in 1990 with George HW Bush.

The scene repeated outside Washington. The former president's casket was removed from the plane, cannons fired and a military band played. A hearse emblazoned with the seal of the president joined a motorcade that

steered toward Washington.

A bipartisan delegation of members of Congress were led in to the Capitol rotunda by Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Democrats who represent Carter's home state. Three of the nine US supreme court justices were also present. Justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan stood next to the Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, in the rotunda.

The US army band brass quintet played as people awaited the casket's arrival.

Carter, who died 29 December at the age of 100, will lie in state on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday. He receives a state funeral on Thursday at Washington National Cathedral. Joe

Biden will deliver a eulogy.

There are the familiar rituals that follow a president's death: the air force ride back to the Beltway, a military honor guard carrying a flag-draped casket up the Capitol steps, the Lincoln catafalque in the Rotunda.

There also will be symbolism unique to Carter. As he was carried from his presidential center, a military band played hymns - Amazing Grace and Blessed Assurance for the outspoken Baptist evangelical who called himself a "born-again Christian" when he sought and won the presidency in 1976. In Washington, his hearse stopped at the US Navy Memorial, where his remains were transferred to a horse-drawn caisson for the rest of

his trip to the Capitol. The location nods to Carter's place as the lone US Naval Academy graduate to become commander-in-chief.

All of the pomp carries some irony for the Democrat who went from his family peanut warehouse to the governor's mansion and eventually the White House. Carter won the presidency as the smiling southerner and technocratic engineer who promised to change the ways of Washington - and eschewed many of those unwritten rules when he got there.

From 1977 to 1981, Carter was Washington's highest-ranking resident. But he never mastered it.
