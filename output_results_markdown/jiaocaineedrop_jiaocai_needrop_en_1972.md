1 观察物体(三)第1课时 观察物体(三)(1)1. 左 上 正解析:几何体从正面看到的是三个小正方形排成一排;从左面看到的是两个小正方形排成一排;从上面看到的小正方形有两排,上面一排只有最左面一个小正方形,下面一排有三个小正方形。

2. (1)①和③解析:从正面看,①看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]() ,②看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the bottom square.]() ,③看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the left end of the bottom square.]() ,④看到的图形是 ![2x2 square made of 4 squares.]()。

(2)④ ③解析:从左面看,①看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the bottom square.]() ,②看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the left end of the bottom square.]() ,③看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the top square.]() ,④看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the left end of the top square.]()。

(3)2解析:观察可知③是由4个小正方体摆成的,若要从上面看到的图形不变,则最下面一层的3个小正方体不动,上面的1个可以放在这3个小正方体任意一个的上面,即还有2种摆法。

3. (1)D 解析:A项是从正面看到的图形,B项是从上面看到的图形,C项是从右面看到的图形,D项是从左面看到的图形。(2)A B 解析:四个几何体从正面看到的图形分别是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]() , ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the bottom square.]() , ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the left end of the bottom square.]() 和 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the left end of the top square.]() ;从左面看到的图形分别是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the bottom square.]() , ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the left end of the bottom square.]() , ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the top square.]() 和 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the left end of the top square.]()。

(3)D 解析:要使从左面看到的图形不变,添加的小正方体应放在几何体的左面或右面,一共有4种摆法。

4. (√) (√)() (√)解析:第三个几何体从正面看是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]()。

5. (1)6解析:从上面看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]() ,用了3个小正方体。如果用5个小正方体摆,另外2个小正方体可以放在这3个小正方体的任意1个或2个上面(如图),这样

从上面看到的图形不变。![Six different arrangements of 6 unit cubes, all showing the same top view (L-shape made of 3 squares).]()![](_page_0_Picture_20.jpeg)

(2)(答案不唯一)如果从上面看到的图形不变,用6个同样的小正方体摆一摆,有几种不同的摆法?

10种解析:从上面看到的图形是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]() ,用了3个小正方体。如果用6个小正方体,另外3个小正方体可以放在这3个小正方体的任意1个或2个上面,也可以这3个小正方体,每个上面放1个,这样从上面看到的图形不变。

6. 4![A 3D arrangement of 4 unit cubes forming a cross shape.]()![](_page_0_Picture_25.jpeg)

解析:如上图,一共有4个小正方体三面涂红色(图中阴影部分)。可以逐个思考每个小正方体涂红色的面数。

(1)②③④ (2)①⑥解析:②③④从正面看是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the top square.]() ,从左面看是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the bottom square.]() ;①⑥从正面看是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row horizontally, 1 attached vertically to the right end of the bottom square.]() ,从左面看是 ![L-shape made of 3 squares, 2 in a row vertically, 1 attached horizontally to the right end of the top square.]()。

2. 从正面看: 从上面看: 从左面看![Three views of a 3D shape on a grid: Front view (L-shape), Top view (L-shape), and Left view (L-shape).]()![](_page_0_Picture_34.jpeg)

解析:从不同的方向观察同一个几何体所看到的形状
