♣ J 6 5There are many worthwhile conventions that enable a good defensive pair to score all the tricks to which they're entitled. Some players ignore these conventions, relying more on instinct than science, but this is a dangerous way to play the game.

Take the present deal, which features top-notch partnership defence. West leads a club, East winning dummy's queen with the ace. East, diagnosing the lead as a possible singleton, returns the three of clubs, ruffed by West with the deuce.

East's return of the three, rather than just any club, is conventional. It says that, as between hearts and diamonds, he would prefer that West lead the lower-ranking suit next. (Had East preferred a heart return, he would have led the eight of clubs to ask for the higher-ranking suit.)

Accordingly, West leads the diamond three to East's queen and South's ace. Declarer plays a trump to dummy's jack and East has a genuine problem.

If he thinks West has another trump, East should return a club; but if he thinks West has no more trumps, his best chance is a diamond return. With only his own 13 cards to rely on, East might easily go wrong and hand South the contract. But another convention, the trump echo, comes to his rescue.

West's ruff with the two of spades, followed later by the play of the four, denies a holding of three trumps. If West had started with the 6-4-2, for example, he would have ruffed the club at trick two with the four and later played the deuce to indicate possession of a third trump.

East therefore returns a diamond at trick five, and four spades goes down two. With a club return, South makes the contract.
