# Slope

- Slope = rise/run
- $= \Delta y / \Delta x$
- $= (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)$
- Order of points 1 and 2 not critical, but keeping them together is
- Points may lie in any quadrant: slope will work out
- Leibniz notation for derivative based on  $\Delta y / \Delta x$ ; the derivative is written  $dy/dx$

Diagram illustrating the calculation of slope (rise over run) on a coordinate plane. The diagram shows a right triangle formed by the change in vertical position (Rise) and the change in horizontal position (Run) between two points on a dashed line. The horizontal axis is marked with  $x_1$  and  $x_2$ , and the horizontal distance is labeled "Run". The vertical axis is marked with  $y_1$  and  $y_2$ , and the vertical distance is labeled "Rise". Arrows indicate the positive direction for both Rise and Run, corresponding to a positive slope.
