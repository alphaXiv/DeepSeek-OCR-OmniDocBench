BY ANDREA PETERSENA new study is helping to answer a pressing nutrition question: Which ultra-processed foods are harming our health—and which might not be so bad?

The problem is the way many packaged foods are made, researchers believe. Products such as many frozen pizzas, cereals and chips pack more calories per gram than less-processed foods do. And most ultra-processed foods have combinations of salt, fat, sugar and carbohydrates that aren't generally found in nature, which can make us crave them. Diets high in packaged foods without those traits—such as canned peaches or refried beans—don't seem to lead people to overeat and gain weight, at least not as much.

Those are the findings so far of a continuing study investigating how ultra-processed food affects our bodies. Scientists presented their interim data at a workshop put on by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December.

"There might be a way to create the quote, unquote healthy ultra-processed food that's still convenient," said Kevin D. Hall, the principal investigator of the study and a scientist at the NIH, giving an example of a frozen meal with brown rice, beans and a lot of vegetables.

Ultra-processed foods make up about 58% of the calories that U.S. adults and children ages 1 and older consume in a day, according to an analysis of federal data. Foods are generally considered ultra-processed if they contain ingredients that you wouldn't find in a home kitchen, such as high-fructose corn syrup and emulsifiers. Yet many scientists believe not all these foods are equally bad—and some might be reasonably healthy.

Recent studies have linked diets high in ultra-processed foods to increased risks of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and depression. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president-elect's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, blames chemicals and additives in food for widespread health problems.

#### 'Energy dense'

When companies make, say, an energy bar, they often break down the cellular structure of the raw ingredients and remove the water, Hall said. Getting rid of water makes sense for food safety, Hall said, since moisture promotes the growth of bacteria.

The process also makes foods more energy dense—meaning they contain more calories per gram than many minimally processed foods do. In the study, the meals with energy-dense foods had about two calories per gram, compared with about one calorie per gram for the meals with fewer energy-dense foods.

In addition, many packaged foods combine fat, sugar, sodium and carbs in ways typically not found in nature. For instance, bagels are usually high in carbs and

## Researchers Dig Into Risks Of Ultra-Processed Foods

How packaged products are made could hold answers to why some are more unhealthy

sodium, muffins are high in fat and sugar, and french fries are high in fat and sodium.

Researchers call these types of foods "hyperpalatable" and they have a strong effect on our brain's reward system, said Tera Fazzino, associate director of the CoFirin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment at the University of Kansas. This makes it difficult to

stop eating them, Fazzino said.

Many seemingly healthy foods are hyperpalatable, including many full-fat flavored yogurts (high fat, high sugar). Salted nuts are hyperpalatable (high sodium, high fat), but plain, unsalted nuts aren't.

Plain nuts "are good, they are pleasant to consume, but I don't eat the whole can in one sitting," Fazzino said.

#### The study

In the current NIH study, 36 participants live for a month at a facility where their meals are tightly controlled. They spend each week on one of four diets. They are offered about 6,000 calories a day and can eat as much as they like.

For one week, they eat minimally processed foods such as plain oatmeal with strawberries and walnuts. For the other weeks, they get versions of an ultra-processed diet.

In one, the meals are energy dense—such as packaged oatmeal with added protein powder, sugar and cream and sweetened cranberries—with most calories coming from hard-to-resist hyperpalatable foods, like honey-roasted peanuts.

In a second ultra-processed diet, meals are energy dense, but fewer calories come from those

hard-to-resist foods. The third diet included foods such as scrambled eggs from a liquid egg product with spinach, flavored yogurt and packaged oatmeal with fiber powder and heavy cream. Those meals weren't energy-dense or hard to resist.

The diets contain roughly the same amounts of calories, fat, sugar, sodium and fiber.

In interim results, which came from 18 people, participants reported feeling just as full and satisfied on all the diets. But when they were on the energy-dense diet with foods such as honey-roasted peanuts, they ate about 1,000 more calories a day than they did while eating the diet with plain oatmeal with strawberries and walnuts.

Not all the ultra-processed diets had such dramatic calorie differences. When people were on the ultra-processed diet that was neither energy dense nor hyperpalatable, they consumed only about 170 calories more a day.

People gained about 1 pound after a week on the energy-dense and hard-to-resist diet. They lost about a half a pound on the minimally processed diet—and also on the one with the liquid-scrambled-egg product.

The findings suggest that eating packaged foods doesn't automatically result in overeating or weight gain, as long as you stick to foods such as canned refried beans or fruit cocktail, which are low in calories per gram and don't have the problematic combinations of fat, salt, carbs and sugar.

There are other concerns about convenience foods beyond weight gain. Some of the additives that many contain have been linked to health problems.

#### What you can do

The NIH research isn't complete. But its findings so far suggest you can choose healthier packaged foods by checking labels and calculating calories per gram. Avoid foods that clock in at two calories per gram or more, such as frozen meatballs, and stick to those that are around one calorie per gram, like low-fat flavored yogurt.

Or you can combine foods to dilute the overall energy density of your meal, Hall said. Instead of eating chicken fingers with mac and cheese, have them with a big salad.

To avoid hyperpalatable foods, look for products that are low in sodium, Fazzino says. This can include items such as low-sodium frozen meals and soups, she says.

#### WHERE TO FIND HEALTHIER OPTIONS

Preliminary study results and other research suggest that healthier choices for ultra-processed foods include

- Canned peaches
- Canned refried beans
- Canned fruit cocktail
- Jarred salsa
- Low-sodium soups
- Low-fat flavored yogurt

## Find Your Digital Photos to Organize

BY SHARA TIBKENSort through old photos. It's that to-do list item that keeps getting pushed down to make room for tasks that aren't so overwhelming.

Who even knows where all those digital files are? There are tens of thousands of images in your iCloud. And more in your Google and Facebook accounts. And your dusty old hard drives. And even those old photo CDs you got from Walgreens a million years ago.

But you've got to start somewhere, and now is the time. Plan to download photo files from wherever they might be stashed. Set up a system—such as a spreadsheet or sticky notes—to keep track of all the places you've checked, advises David Shor, co-founder of Tidy Haus, a home- and digital-organization company based in Fort Worth, Texas.

"You want to have a little bit of project management in place so you don't mess up," he says.

Here's a checklist for making sure you don't miss anything.

#### Search your Mac or PC

Think all your photos are stored in that folder neatly labeled Pictures? Think again. Odds are high that images are lurking in a Downloads folder or other random corners of your laptop.

On a Mac, you can search by kind and select "image" or even specific image file types, including JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP and HEIC. (You can also search for "movie" files.) On Windows, you can search inside the taskbar, and can narrow down your query by specific file types.

#### Download from Google

If you use the Google Photos app on your phone or computer, it's easy to download the stored files using Google's Takeout tool.

On your computer, open a Google webpage and click your picture in the top right corner. Choose "Manage Your Google Account," then select "Data & privacy." Choose "Download your data," select what items you want to receive and how you want to receive them (such as a download link). You'll get a zip file you can then open and sift through.

If you select Google Drive in the tool, you'll also download all other files you saved there. It might be too much. If you think you have images hiding in Google Drive, skip Takeout and just look around by filtering your search to "Photos & images."

#### Collect iCloud photos

If you have an iPhone, you almost certainly have photos saved in iCloud. You can see and download them by going to iCloud.com/photos and signing in with your Apple ID.

buy prints, but you can't share or download photos until you make a purchase. Shutterfly-owned Snapfish has the same policy.

Flickr limits free accounts to 1,000 items and 50 nonpublic images. If you uploaded more than that back when Flickr was more widely used and had higher free-storage limits, the excess images are probably gone.

#### Hunt through old drives and CDs

You probably have an old hard drive, flash drive or stack of CDs and DVDs somewhere with photos from your wedding, the birth of your first child or the birthday of a long-gone loved one.

Most laptops today don't have CD drives—or even the older USB-A ports. You might need to invest in a dongle adapter and an external CD/DVD drive. Luckily, neither of those will break the bank.

In some cases, you might find a dead hard drive or even an old phone or tablet that you can't turn on but you suspect might contain some precious memories. If irreplaceable images are on the line, you may want to visit a tech repair shop.

Once you have all your digital photos in one place, backing them up to an external drive or cataloging them in your Photos app will be a lot easier. Then you can start worrying about all the photo prints you have stuffed in boxes in the attic.

You can also find them in the Photos app on your Mac, if you have iCloud photo sharing turned on.

#### Check Facebook

Many of us have had Facebook accounts for over a decade and probably shared photos from old cameras we no longer own.

Navigate to Meta's Accounts Center to download your photos. Choose "Your information and permissions" from the left toolbar and then select "Download your information." Choose which account you want to download (for instance, Facebook and/or Instagram), then decide how much data you want—everything available or specific types of information.

▲ Photos are often forgotten on Flickr, Dropbox and other accounts.

Make a list to check for them.

Photos isn't a download category of its own. You have to select Posts to get images, then choose the time frame and media quality you want to download.

#### Look at old accounts

Did you ever keep photos in Flickr, Shutterfly, Dropbox or a similar storage service? If you haven't logged in lately, those photos may be purged, so log in and check. In the case of Shutterfly, if you don't make a purchase every 18 months, your photos will be archived. You can still see them and
