For linear programming, the important alternatives come when the constraints are inequalities. When is the feasible set empty (no  $x$ )?

**8J**  $Ax \ge b$  has a solution  $x \ge 0$  or there is a  $y \le 0$  with  $yA \ge 0$  and  $yb < 0$ .

*Proof.* The slack variables  $w = Ax - b$  change  $Ax \ge b$  into an equation. Use 8I:

**First alternative** 
$$\begin{bmatrix} A & -I \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ w \end{bmatrix} = b \quad \text{for some} \quad \begin{bmatrix} x \\ w \end{bmatrix} \ge 0.$$

**Second alternative** 
$$y \begin{bmatrix} A & -I \end{bmatrix} \ge \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{for some } y \text{ with } yb < 0.$$

It is this result that leads to a “nonconstructive proof” of the duality theorem.

### Problem Set 8.3

1. What is the dual of the following problem: Minimize  $x_1 + x_2$ , subject to  $x_1 \ge 0$ ,  $x_2 \ge 0$ ,  $2x_1 \ge 4$ ,  $x_1 + 3x_2 \ge 11$ ? Find the solution to both this problem and its dual, and verify that minimum equals maximum.
2. What is the dual of the following problem: Maximize  $y_2$  subject to  $y_1 \ge 0$ ,  $y_2 \ge 0$ ,  $y_1 + y_2 \le 3$ ? Solve both this problem and its dual.
3. Suppose  $A$  is the identity matrix (so that  $m = n$ ), and the vectors  $b$  and  $c$  are nonnegative. Explain why  $x^* = b$  is optimal in the minimum problem, find  $y^*$  in the maximum problem, and verify that the two values are the same. If the first component of  $b$  is negative, what are  $x^*$  and  $y^*$ ?
4. Construct a 1 by 1 example in which  $Ax \ge b$ ,  $x \ge 0$  is unfeasible, and the dual problem is unbounded.
5. Starting with the 2 by 2 matrix  $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ , choose  $b$  and  $c$  so that both of the feasible sets  $Ax \ge b$ ,  $x \ge 0$  and  $yA \le c$ ,  $y \ge 0$  are empty.
6. If all entries of  $A$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  are positive, show that both the primal and the dual are feasible.

1. Show that  $x = (1, 1, 1, 0)$  and  $y = (1, 1, 0, 1)$  are feasible in the primal and dual, with

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad c = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}.$$

Then, after computing  $cx$  and  $yb$ , explain how you know they are optimal.
