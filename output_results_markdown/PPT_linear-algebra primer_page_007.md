# Projection: Using Inner Products (I)

![A 2D coordinate system (x1, x2) showing vectors x and a originating from the origin. Vector x is projected onto the line defined by vector a. The scalar projection length is labeled as x^T a.]()A 2D coordinate system with axes labeled  $x_1$  (horizontal) and  $x_2$  (vertical), originating at  $0$ . Two vectors,  $x$  and  $a$ , originate from the origin. Vector  $x$  is projected orthogonally onto the line containing vector  $a$ . The resulting projection vector lies along  $a$ . The scalar component of the projection, which is the length of the projection vector along  $a$ , is labeled  $x^T a$ . This diagram illustrates the projection of vector  $x$  onto the direction of vector  $a$ .

Projection of  $x$  along the direction  $a$  ( $\|a\| = 1$ ).

$$p = a (a^T x)$$

$$\|a\| = a^T a = 1$$
