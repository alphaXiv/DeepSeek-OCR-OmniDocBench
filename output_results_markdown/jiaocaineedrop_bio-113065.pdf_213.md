### SKELETAL MUSCLE PAIRS

To move bones in opposite directions, skeletal muscles often consist of muscle pairs that work in opposition to one another. For example, when the biceps muscle (on the front of the upper arm) contracts, it can cause the elbow joint to flex or bend the arm, as shown in Figure 6.3.5. When the triceps muscle (on the back of the upper arm) contracts, it can cause the elbow to extend or straighten the arm. The

biceps and triceps muscles are examples of a muscle pair where the muscles work in opposition to each other.

![Figure 6.3.5: Diagram illustrating the opposing action of the Bicep and Tricep muscles in the upper arm. The top illustration shows the arm extended, with the Bicep relaxed and the Tricep contracted. An accompanying diagram shows a Stretched Elastic Band (Relaxed Muscle). The bottom illustration shows the arm flexed, with the Bicep contracted and the Tricep relaxed. An accompanying diagram shows an Elastic Band Shortens (contracting muscle).]()Stretched Elastic Band (Relaxed Muscle)

### SKELETAL MUSCLE STRUCTURE

Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds — or even thousands — of skeletal muscle fibers, which are long, string-like cells. As shown in Figure 6.3.6, skeletal muscle fibers are individually wrapped in connective tissue called **endomysium**. The skeletal muscle fibers are bundled together in units called **muscle fascicles**, surrounded by sheaths of connective tissue called **perimysium**. Each fascicle contains between ten and 100 (or even more!) skeletal muscle fibers. Fascicles, in turn, are bundled together to form individual skeletal muscles, which are wrapped in connective tissue called **epimysium**. The connective tissues in skeletal muscles have a variety of functions. They support and protect muscle fibers, allowing them to withstand contraction forces by distributing the forces applied to the muscle. They also provide pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach the muscles. Also, the epimysium anchors the muscles to tendons.

#### Structure of a Skeletal Muscle

![Figure 6.3.6: Diagram illustrating the structure of a skeletal muscle. The muscle is shown attached to a Bone via a Tendon. The muscle structure is shown in cross-section, revealing bundles within bundles. The entire muscle is wrapped in Epimysium. Bundles of muscle fibers form a Fascicle, which is wrapped in Perimysium. Individual Muscle fibers are wrapped in Endomysium. A Blood vessel and Muscle fiber are also shown.]()Bone

Figure 6.3.6: Each skeletal muscle has a structure of bundles within bundles. Bundles of muscle fibers make up a muscle fascicle, and fascicles' bundles make up a skeletal muscle. At each level of bundling, a connective tissue membrane surrounds the bundle. The muscle cells, fascicle, and the whole muscle are surrounded by Endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium, respectively. All connective tissues merge together to make a tendon that attaches the muscle to bones.
