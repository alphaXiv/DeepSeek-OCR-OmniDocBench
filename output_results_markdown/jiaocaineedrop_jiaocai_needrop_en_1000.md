In this part of the experiment you will need the equipment shown in Fig. 1.6.

![Figure 1.6 shows the equipment for experiment 1.3. Items labeled A, B, C, and D are visible: A points to an optical vessel with water and a measuring tape; B points to a small magnet; C points to an angle iron with self-adhesive foam pads; D points to a strip of self-adhesive foam pads. Other items include a plastic bottle, a ruler, a metal angle iron, a digital distance meter (LDM), a roll of tape, and a pair of scissors.]()![](_page_0_Picture_4.jpeg)

Figure 1.6 Equipment for experiment 1.3 shown in the figure:

**A**: Optical vessel with water and measuring tape  
**B**: Magnet to secure the angle iron on top of the black box. (You find magnet placed on the angle iron).  
**C**: Angle iron with self-adhesive foam pads  
**D**: Self-adhesive foam pads

**Remove the black felt pad from the lens.** The LDM should now be placed in the following set-up:  
Place two self-adhesive foam pads on the angle iron, see **A** on Fig. 1.7.
