STAGEAudiences will fall for the stage magic in 'Death Becomes Her'Patrick Ryan USA TODAYSevered nogginns, staircase tumbles and gaping stomach wounds.

With all the onstage magic happening in "Death Becomes Her," it's enough to make your head spin. Adapted from the 1992 camp classic starring Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, the lavish new Broadway musical serves up irreverent comedy with dumbfounding feats of theatrical sorcery.

The show tells the story of caustic best frenemies Madeline (Megan Hilty) and Helen (Jennifer Simard), who ingest a purple potion from a mysterious socialite (Michelle Williams) that gives them eternal youth. But the transformative elixir has unsavory side effects: Even the slightest knock to their va-va-voom figures causes irreparable blemishes. So when the gloves come off and the ladies brawl, all manner of absurd body horror ensues.

The movie won an Oscar for its outrageous visual effects. So naturally, illusionist Tim Clothier was daunted when he got the call about helping bring "Death Becomes Her" to the New York stage (taking the mantle from Rob Lake, who oversaw the effects for the show's Chicago tryout early last year).

"I knew the movie and thought, 'Gosh, there's going to be some very tricky bits to work out,'" says Clothier, whose past credits include Cirque du Soleil and Blue Man Group. "It's not a spectacle in Vegas where the magic takes center stage — here, the magic needs to drive the story. So we really had to pull from our box of tricks. From a historical perspective, there are references to classic things that magicians would normally do, as well as some groundbreaking things we developed that no one's really tried before."

**'Death Becomes Her' pulls off a jaw-dropping staircase scene**The show's action centerpiece, if you will, is the Act 1 finale. In a heated confrontation with Helen and Ernest (Christopher Sieber), the shubby object of both their affections, Madeline is pushed down a mansion staircase, crunching her bones and mangling her limbs all the way down.

The slow-motion plunge is one of the movie's iconic images, and director/choreographer Christopher Gattelli ("Newsies") racked his brain for months about how to bring that to life on stage.

"We literally tried everything: puppets, throwing dolls downstairs, exercise balls with wigs on them. We thought maybe we could build a robot,"

But he eventually cracked the code when he met actor/dancer Warren Yang, an Olympic-trained gymnast who now serves as the production's acrobatics captain.

"I was on Instagram and I saw a video of Warren literally changing his clothes while he was doing a handstand," Gattelli says. "I was like, 'Wait a minute.' I reached out to him and was like, 'I can see a world where there's a pommel horse routine down a flight of stairs.' And he was like, 'Oh, I'm all in — let's play.'"

Gattelli calls the sequence a "true collaborative effort," working with lighting designer Justin Townsend ("Moulin Rouge! The Musical") and costume designer Paul Tazewell ("Wicked") to cleverly achieve the illusion that it's actually Hilty and not Yang toppling down the stairs. He also had to find other dancers with that particular skill set, should Yang ever need to call out of a performance.

"It's an epic moment that everyone is waiting for and I was just thrilled where it landed," Gattelli says. "Warren stops the show every night with it. There are no wires — he's literally doing these handstands and cartwheels and flips. It's a total free fall and I just cannot believe he can do that."

**The show's neck-twisting illusions are old-school 'theatrical magic'**From there, the musical's optical illusions only get wilder: Madeline has her head knocked off during a shovel-wielding showdown, with the help of stunt doubles and props including an eye-tricking serving cart. She also blows a hole through Helen's stomach with a shotgun. Of course, unlike the movie, audiences cannot see directly through Simard's torso, which instead billows smoke throughout Act 2.

"I can't share the secrets because then I would have to kill you," Clothier says slyly. "But there were many different iterations of that throughout development."

The moment, too, when an arrow flies through Helen's belly is based on a "classic magic effect from the 1890s. We had to find visual ways to tell the story of someone who's had a hole blown through their stomach, and that was one of those."

The image of Madeline's head doing a

full 360 is also "just good old-fashioned theatrical magic," Gattelli adds. "If you really look at it, it's not hard to tell how it happens. But if the audience is on the ride, it's OK if you see a little bit of how the sausage is made. It's happening live right in front of you, and it's satisfying that the audience eats it up the way they do."

Gattelli is quick to note that it takes "dozens of people" to pull off these illusions eight shows a week. An hour before each performance, various cast and crew members are behind the curtain running through each and every stunt to ensure they're safe.

"No one takes anything for granted," Gattelli says. "It really frees everyone up, so when they do the show, they can feel confident and breathe and be funny. It helps them let loose and give those amazing performances — and that's always the goal."

"Death Becomes Her" is now playing at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre (205 W 46th St.).

TV PREVIEWFox's 'Doc' is a drama to forgetKelly Lawler USA TODAYNot long into watching Fox's new amnesia drama "Doc," I had a desperate desire to turn the TV off.

There are certainly worse TV series than "Doc" (Tuesdays, 9 EST/PST, ★★★★), which follows Dr. Amy Larsen (Molly Parker), a callous medical professional who loses eight years of her memory after a traumatic brain injury. There are series with lazy writing, shallow characters, boring plots and even offensive elements. But the sin of this particular series is one that's hard to get over: deep unpleasantness.

"Doc" is, as the kids might say, "cringe." It's awkward, unenjoyable and irritating. At times it's actively depressing, and not what I would classify as "entertainment."

In spite of the efforts of creator Barbie Kingman ("Magnum, PI"), Parker and the rest of the cast, "Doc" never coalesces into a coherent and functional TV show. It flatlines from its first few moments.

Amy is every stereotype TV has ever developed about an unfeeling doctor who is brilliant but lacks bedside manner. Her patients hate hanging out with her, but she gets results, gosh darn it. She's chief of internal medicine at a Minneapolis hospital where she annoys her ex-husband and hospital administrator Michael (Omar Metwally), stands in the way of ambitious hack Dr. Richard Miller (Scott Wolf) and makes time for discreet rendezvous with young hunk Dr. Jake Eller (Jon-Michael Ecker).

But all of that is thrown into chaos when Amy is in a car accident that leaves her with a traumatic brain injury. When she wakes up from surgery she thinks that it's 2016 and that she's married to Michael. She also thinks her daughter is 9 and her son is alive, and she is hit with major grief to learn her daughter is 17 and her son died seven

Molly Parker stars as Dr. Amy Larsen in "Doc." PROVIDED BY PETER H. STRANKS/FOXyears ago. Oh, and she's a much nicer person without those eight years, too.

The concept, based on an Italian series, has potential. But "Doc" never does anything interesting with the plot. It's all reduced to simplistic binaries. Amnesia Amy is good, present-day Amy is bad. Amy is a medical genius and the rest of the doctors are pale imitations. Amy loves her ex-husband, who has moved on. Amy's new fling can't tell her they were together because of office politics. It's all rather tedious.

And ultimately it's uncomfortable, and not in the good way. Amy's every interaction is loaded with dramatic irony, but the audience isn't in a good spot knowing that her teenage daughter actually hates her or that the new chief of internal medicine is a quack who killed a patient. We're just kind of stressed out by it.

It's a shame, because Parker is a first-rate actress with great credits including "Deadwood" and "House of Cards." She is almost enough of a talent to build this creaky show around, but not quite.

The series can't decide if it cares more about Amy's amnesia and personal relationships or the case-of-the-week medical drama.

Each episode is heavily unbalanced and poorly paced.

Watching TV shouldn't feel like this much work. I'd rather forget all about it.
