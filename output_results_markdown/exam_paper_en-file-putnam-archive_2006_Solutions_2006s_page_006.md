B-4 The maximum is  $2^k$ , achieved for instance by the subspace

$$\{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n : x_1 = \dots = x_{n-k} = 0\}.$$

**First solution:** More generally, we show that any affine  $k$ -dimensional plane in  $\mathbb{R}^n$  can contain at most  $2^k$  points in  $Z$ . The proof is by induction on  $k+n$ ; the case  $k=n=0$  is clearly true.

Suppose that  $V$  is a  $k$ -plane in  $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Denote the hyperplanes  $\{x_n = 0\}$  and  $\{x_n = 1\}$  by  $V_0$  and  $V_1$ , respectively. If  $V \cap V_0$  and  $V \cap V_1$  are each at most  $(k-1)$ -dimensional, then  $V \cap V_0 \cap Z$  and  $V \cap V_1 \cap Z$  each have cardinality at most  $2^{k-1}$  by the induction assumption, and hence  $V \cap Z$  has at most  $2^k$  elements. Otherwise, if  $V \cap V_0$  or  $V \cap V_1$  is  $k$ -dimensional, then  $V \subset V_0$  or  $V \subset V_1$ ; now apply the induction hypothesis on  $V$ , viewed as a subset of  $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$  by dropping the last coordinate.

**Second solution:** Let  $S$  be a subset of  $Z$  contained in a  $k$ -dimensional subspace of  $V$ . This is equivalent to asking that any  $t_1, \dots, t_{k+1} \in S$  satisfy a nontrivial linear dependence  $c_1 t_1 + \dots + c_{k+1} t_{k+1} = 0$  with  $c_1, \dots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ . Since  $t_1, \dots, t_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ , given such a dependence we can always find another one with  $c_1, \dots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Q}$ ; then by clearing denominators, we can find one with  $c_1, \dots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Z}$  and not all having a common factor.

Let  $\mathbb{F}_2$  denote the field of two elements, and let  $\bar{S} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$  be the reductions modulo 2 of the points of  $S$ . Then any  $t_1, \dots, t_{k+1} \in \bar{S}$  satisfy a nontrivial linear dependence, because we can take the dependence from the end of the previous paragraph and reduce modulo 2. Hence  $\bar{S}$  is contained in a  $k$ -dimensional subspace of  $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ , and the latter has cardinality exactly  $2^k$ . Thus  $\bar{S}$  has at most  $2^k$  elements, as does  $S$ .

Variant (suggested by David Savitt): if  $\bar{S}$  contained  $k+1$  linearly independent elements, the  $(k+1) \times n$  matrix formed by these would have a nonvanishing maximal minor. The lift of that minor back to  $\mathbb{R}$  would also not vanish, so  $S$  would contain  $k+1$  linearly independent elements.

**Third solution:** (by Catalin Zara) Let  $V$  be a  $k$ -dimensional subspace. Form the matrix whose rows are the elements of  $V \cap Z$ ; by construction, it has row rank at most  $k$ . It thus also has column rank at most  $k$ ; in particular, we can choose  $k$  coordinates such that each point of  $V \cap Z$  is determined by those  $k$  of its coordinates. Since each coordinate of a point in  $Z$  can only take two values,  $V \cap Z$  can have at most  $2^k$  elements.

**Remark:** The proposers probably did not realize that this problem appeared online about three months before the exam, at <http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=105991>. (It may very well have also appeared even earlier.)

B-5 The answer is  $1/16$ . We have

$$\begin{aligned} & \int_0^1 x^2 f(x) dx - \int_0^1 x f(x)^2 dx \\ &= \int_0^1 (x^3/4 - x(f(x) - x/2)^2) dx \\ &\le \int_0^1 x^3/4 dx = 1/16, \end{aligned}$$

with equality when  $f(x) = x/2$ .

B-6 **First solution:** We start with some easy upper and lower bounds on  $a_n$ . We write  $O(f(n))$  and  $\Omega(f(n))$  for functions  $g(n)$  such that  $f(n)/g(n)$  and  $g(n)/f(n)$ , respectively, are bounded above. Since  $a_n$  is a non-decreasing sequence,  $a_{n+1} - a_n$  is bounded above, so  $a_n = O(n)$ . That means  $a_n^{-1/k} = \Omega(n^{-1/k})$ , so

$$a_n = \Omega\left(\sum_{i=1}^n i^{-1/k}\right) = \Omega(n^{(k-1)/k}).$$

In fact, all we will need is that  $a_n \to \infty$  as  $n \to \infty$ .

By Taylor's theorem with remainder, for  $1 < m < 2$  and  $x > 0$ ,

$$|(1+x)^m - 1 - mx| \le \frac{m(m-1)}{2} x^2.$$

Taking  $m = (k+1)/k$  and  $x = a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + a_n^{-(k+1)/k}$ , we obtain

$$\left| a_{n+1}^{(k+1)/k} - a_n^{(k+1)/k} - \frac{k+1}{k} \right| \le \frac{k+1}{2k^2} a_n^{-(k+1)/k}.$$

In particular,

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n+1}^{(k+1)/k} - a_n^{(k+1)/k} = \frac{k+1}{k}.$$

In general, if  $x_n$  is a sequence with  $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = c$ , then also

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = c$$

by Cesaro's lemma. Explicitly, for any  $\varepsilon > 0$ , we can find  $N$  such that  $|x_n - c| \le \varepsilon/2$  for  $n \ge N$ , and then

$$\left| c - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right| \le \frac{n-N}{n} \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{N}{n} \left| \sum_{i=1}^N (c - x_i) \right|;$$

for  $n$  large, the right side is smaller than  $\varepsilon$ .

In our case, we deduce that

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n^{(k+1)/k}}{n} = \frac{k+1}{k}$$

and so

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n^{k+1}}{n^k} = \left( \frac{k+1}{k} \right)^k,$$
