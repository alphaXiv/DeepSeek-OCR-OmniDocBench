Monitor Characteristic Curve

Graph showing the relationship between Luminance (Y-axis, logarithmic scale, labeled  $\log_{10}$  luminance  $\text{cd}/\text{m}^2$ , ranging from 0.01 to 100) and Digital Driving Level (X-axis, ranging from 0 to 300). The curve illustrates the monitor's characteristic response, showing a baseline luminance level (indicated by the "Ambient Light" arrow) at low Digital Driving Levels, followed by a non-linear increase in luminance as the Digital Driving Level increases.
