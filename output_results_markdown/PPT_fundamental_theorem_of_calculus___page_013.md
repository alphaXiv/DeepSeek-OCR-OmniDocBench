eg if  $y = f(x) = 3x^2$  and  $a = 2$  and  $b = 4$ 

$$\text{then Area A} = \int_{2}^{4} 3x^2 dx$$

$$= \left[ x^3 \right]_{2}^{4}$$

$$= \left[ 4^3 \right] - \left[ 2^3 \right]$$

$$= 64 - 8$$

$$= 56 \text{ units}^2$$

![Graph of the function y = 3x^2. The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4, marked every 2 units. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 60, marked every 10 units. The curve is a parabola opening upwards, passing through the origin (0, 0). The area A, representing the definite integral from x=2 to x=4, is indicated between the curve and the x-axis, bounded by vertical lines at x=2 and x=4.]()![](_page_0_Figure_6.jpeg)
