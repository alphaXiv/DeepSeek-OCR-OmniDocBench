trade adviser.

Top firms across the U.S. are also bracing for major changes in the antitrust landscape. President Biden appointed officials, including Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who sought to increase enforcement to levels not seen in decades. That created a lucrative environment for antitrust lawyers as companies struggled to secure government clearance for a range of proposed mergers and acquisitions.

Trump's new administration likely means a more hands-off approach, which in some ways could reduce the windfall for antitrust litigators and counselors. But the more predictable and favorable regulatory climate, along with economic factors, could drive new corporate dealmaking and provide a healthy stream of legal revenue.

Ropes & Gray antitrust partner Jonathan Klarfeld said he expects his practice area to return to a normal baseline after years of drawn-out enforcement built on progressive and untested legal theories.

"Some of the excesses of recent enforcement are likely to be pared back," Klarfeld said, but added, "There is more than enough work to occupy our time."

The charged political environment is spurring specialty practice areas designed to help clients navigate it.

Labor-law specialist firm Seyfarth Shaw created a cultural-flashpoints task force in 2023 to help clients navigate workplace challenges and respond to rising pressure for companies to take a stance on

social issues, said Lorie Almon, the firm's chair and managing partner.

The firm is now marketing the practice anew after the divisiveness of the 2024 election and a backlash against some policies embraced by progressives. The group helps employers "lower the temperature" around hot-button social and political issues, Almon said.

Law firm Gibson Dunn has built a specialty out of counseling companies that have implemented policies and programs designed to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Such initiatives have been under increasing fire since the Supreme Court in 2023 ended affirmative action in higher education. Trump's election turns up the heat even more because he has campaigned against such initiatives.

"We're definitely seeing and anticipating increased demand and opportunities for

us to help our clients navigate this in a thoughtful, practical and legally defensible way," said firm partner Jason Schwartz.

Firms themselves also face political challenges. One early example came in December, when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said his company wouldn't work with anyone who hires Biden-era officials

who were part of the administration's aggressive enforcement efforts against crypto companies. And he singled out law firm Milbank by name for hiring the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent enforcement director.
