## 20.2 Defect Amplification and Removal

- **Defect Amplification Model**

|                           | Defects                | Detection          |                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Errors from Previous step | Errors passed through  | Percent Efficiency | Errors passed To next step |
|                           | Amplified errors 1:x   |                    |                            |
|                           | Newly generated errors |                    |                            |
| <i>Development step</i>   |                        |                    |                            |

- Assume that an error uncovered during **design** will cost **1.5** monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just **before testing** commences will cost **6.5** units; **during testing**, **15** units; and **after release**, between **67** and **100** units.

- A number of studies indicate that **design activities** introduce between **50% - 65%** of all errors during the software process. However, **formal review technique** have been shown to be up to **75%** effective in uncovering design flaws.
