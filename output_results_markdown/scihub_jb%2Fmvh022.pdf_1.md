(underlined), 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and 5'-GTCACCATGGGCTGGTCCGATTCTGCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with *NcoI*, then inserted into the same site of pBAD *Myc-His C*. To construct pNI6 encoding the hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI with the amino-acid substitution G103D, the mutated *nlpI* in the chromosomal DNA of Rev3 (*spr-1 nlpI3*) was amplified by PCR using the primers described above, and the amplified DNA was digested with the *NcoI* and inserted into the same site of pBAD *Myc-His C*. To construct pNI7 encoding the truncated and hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI, the fragment containing the truncated *nlpI* was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer 5'-GGTCCATGGGGTCCTGGCCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with *NcoI*, then inserted into the same site of pBAD *Myc-His C*. pNI8 and pNI9 were constructed in the same way as pNI7 except that 5'-CATCCATGGCCTGGCCCAGG-3' or 5'-CTTCCATGGGGCCCAGGAGC-3', respectively, was used as the reverse primer in PCR. To construct pNI10 encoding NlpI, the *nlpI* in the chromosomal DNA of W3110 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer containing the *NcoI* site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer containing the *BamHI* site (underlined) 5'-TGGATCCGGCTCAAAGTAGG-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with *NcoI* and *BamHI* and inserted into the same sites of pTrc99A. pNI12, pNI13, and pNI14 were constructed in the same way as pNI10 except that 5'-CCAGGGATCCTTAGTCCTGGCC-3', 5'-GTCAGGATCCTACTGGCCCAG-

3', or 5'-ATCTGGATCCTAGCCCAGGAG-3', respectively, was used as the reverse primer containing the *BamHI* site (underlined) in PCR. The amplified DNA was digested with *NcoI* and *BamHI* and then inserted into the same sites of pTrc99A.

*Expression and Purification of Hexa-Histidine-Tagged NlpI Protein*—*E. coli* cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids. The transformants were grown in L broth at 42°C for 4 h, then incubated in L broth containing 0.01% arabinose at 42°C for 4 h for expression of the fusion genes. Cells from 400 ml of medium were collected, washed once with ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl (buffer A), suspended in 4 ml of the buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole and 1% Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication with cooling by ice-water. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 17,700  $\times g$  to obtain a clear lysate. Four milliliters of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4°C. The mixture was loaded onto an open column. The column was washed with 4 ml each of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and then containing 40 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with 1.2 ml of buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected.

*Mass Spectrometry Analysis*—An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DECA XP ion trap mass system, Thermo Electron) coupled online with a capillary HPLC (Magic 2002, Michrom BioResources) was used to acquire MS/MS spectra. A 0.2  $\times$  50 mm MAGICMS C18
