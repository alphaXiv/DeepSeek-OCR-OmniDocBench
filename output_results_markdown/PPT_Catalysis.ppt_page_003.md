# Activation energy

- Molecules must be activated before they can undergo a reaction
  - Reactants must absorb enough energy from surroundings to destabilize chemical bonds (energy of activation)
- Transition state
  - Intermediate stage in reaction where the reactant molecule is strained or distorted but the reaction has not yet occurred

Reaction coordinate diagram showing Free energy, G, on the vertical axis and reaction progress (A  $\to$  B) on the horizontal axis.

- The Initial state (reactants) is at free energy  $G_A$ .
- The Final state (products) is at free energy  $G_B$ .
- The peak of the curve is the Transition state.
- The Activation Free Energy, labeled  $\Delta G^\ddagger$ , is the energy difference between the Initial state and the Transition state.
- The overall Standard Free Energy Change, labeled  $\Delta G^\circ$ , is the difference between the Initial state ( $G_A$ ) and the Final state ( $G_B$ ).

![Free energy profile diagram showing the reaction coordinate (A to B) versus Free energy (G). The initial state (reactants) is labeled G_A. The final state (products) is labeled G_B. The transition state is the peak of the curve, labeled 'Transition state'. The activation energy is Delta G double dagger. The overall free energy change is Delta G standard.]()![](_page_0_Figure_2.jpeg)
