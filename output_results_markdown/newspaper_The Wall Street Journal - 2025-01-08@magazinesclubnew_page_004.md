U.S. NEWSJudge Bars Release of Report on TrumpA separate bid to delay his coming criminal sentencing in New York is denied

AND CORINNE RAMEY

A federal judge on Tuesday barred the Justice Department from releasing special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation into Donald Trump, while a New York appeals judge denied the president-elect's separate bid to delay his coming criminal sentencing for covering up hush money paid to an adult-film star.

In the Smith case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida issued an order preventing the Justice Department from "releasing, sharing, or transmitting" the special counsel's final report or otherwise distributing information or conclusions from the document while an appeals court considers the matter.

Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously tossed Smith's prosecution of the former president on allegations that

he mishandled classified documents after he left office.

Smith had been appealing that ruling and separately prosecuting Trump in Washington on allegations that he unlawfully interfered with the 2020 election.

The special counsel dropped both efforts after Trump won in November, in light of a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

Gesmer held a hearing Tuesday on whether Trump's hush-money sentencing, set for Friday, could go forward.

Shortly after the hearing concluded, she issued a one-sentence order rejecting Trump's request to stop the proceedings on the grounds of presidential immunity.

"Do you have any support for the notion that presidential immunity extends to presidential elects?" Gesmer asked Trump lawyer Todd Blanche

during the hearing.

"There has never been a case like this before, so no," Blanche replied.

Steven Wu, a lawyer for the Manhattan district attorney's office, called Trump's arguments baseless.

"The theory of president-elect immunity is inconsistent with the idea that there is one president at a time," he told the judge.

The proceedings come as courts and prosecutors are

scrambling to wrap up their unprecedented cases against Trump before Inauguration Day.

In the federal matters, Smith was finalizing a report on his investigation, which he is required to submit to Attorney General Merrick Garland under Justice Department regulations. And Garland had previously indicated that he would make it public.

Trump and his co-defendants in the documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have been seeking to block the report's release. Trump's lawyers in a Monday letter to Garland called the report a political stunt.

They also called for Garland to remove Smith as special counsel. Among the letter's signatories were lawyers Trump has picked for top Justice Department posts, including Blanche, his choice for deputy attorney general.

"Releasing Smith's report is obviously not in the public interest—particularly in light of President Trump's commanding victory in the election and the sensitive nature of the ongoing transition process," Trump's lawyers wrote.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

Smith's team, in a court filing Tuesday, said it was working to finalize a two-volume report and that, if Garland released it, that wouldn't happen before Friday. In a court filing later on Tuesday, Smith said his office would file a more detailed response in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In the New York case, a jury last year convicted Trump of 34 felonies for covering up hush money paid to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election.

In a surprise ruling last week, Justice Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, said he would sentence Trump before the start of his second term, but made clear that jail time wasn't a possibility.

Merchan on Monday declined to postpone the sentencing, prompting Trump's lawyers to ask a state appeals court to intervene.

It wasn't immediately clear what legal options Trump may have remaining to try to head off Friday's proceedings.

bid to take over Greenland. He also questioned whether Denmark has any legal right to control the territory.

"People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security," Trump, a Republican, said.

Representatives for Denmark's foreign ministry and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen didn't respond to requests for comment. Frederiksen said in a Danish television interview on Tuesday that Greenland isn't for sale. "Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland. Our future and fight for independence is our business," Múte Egede, Greenland's prime minister, said in a statement.

Greenland is an autonomous Danish territory with self-government and its own parliament. Denmark, a U.S. ally and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, maintains some control over the island, including its foreign policy. NATO representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.

The president-elect said he would consider using economic coercion to persuade Canada to become part of the U.S., but he

ruled out using military force. "There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States," Trudeau wrote on X on Tuesday afternoon.

"The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable," said Javier Martinez-Acha, Panama's foreign minister. "It is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest."

Trump has accused Panama of charging U.S. shipping and naval vessels high fees for passage through the canal.

The canal, through which about 4% of global trade passes, is crucial for the global economy and U.S. consumers. Control of the canal was gradually given back to Panama as a result of a 1977 treaty signed by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump pointed to the canal as the reason for Carter's loss in the 1980 presidential election.

Trump also said his administration would change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. "What a beautiful name, and it's appropriate," he said.

Ahead of Trump's news conference, Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., arrived in Greenland—in a Trump-branded plane. The elder Trump wrote in a social-media post, "This is a deal that must happen. MAGA. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!"

The president-elect called into a lunchtime gathering of his son and others in Greenland, saying over a speaker phone, "It's a very special place. It needs security for itself, but it also needs security very much for the world."

The younger Trump arrived on Tuesday in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, with an entourage that included conservative activist Charlie Kirk; James Blair, political director of the 2024 campaign and incoming senior White House adviser; and Sergio Gor, who will oversee the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.

Trump's national-security team has had preliminary discussions about a process by which Trump would direct the State Department to undertake negotiations with the governments of Denmark and Greenland, according to people close to the

transition. That could potentially happen through a Compact of Free Association agreement—a financial assistance pact similar to what the U.S. currently has with several Pacific Island nations.

Trump's advisers hope to launch potential negotiations once the president-elect takes office, the people said.

But the Trump administration is likely to pursue a negotiation that is more nuanced

than a real-estate purchase or sweeping annexation, according to the people close to the transition.

During his first term, Trump expressed varying levels of interest in purchasing Greenland after hearing from his aides about its abundant resources and geopolitical importance.

When The Wall Street Journal first reported on Trump's interest in the purchase, Greenland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the island wasn't on the market.

Trump's Tuesday news conference touched on several other topics. On the negotiations to release hostages

seized in Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza, Trump said, "If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone." Trump has appointed Steve Witkoff, a real-estate executive and close ally, as his envoy to the Middle East. On Wednesday, Witkoff is expected to join talks in Doha, Qatar, for a cease-fire in Gaza in exchange for the releases of hostages held by Hamas.

Four years after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, the president-elect said he is looking at potential pardons

for participants charged in the riot, including those charged with violent offenses. "People that were doing some bad things weren't prosecuted, and people that didn't even walk into the building are in jail right now," he said. "So we'll be looking at the whole thing, but I'll be making major pardons."

The president-elect said he is open to pushing his legislative agenda through Congress with either a single large bill or two separate bills, weighing in on an issue that has been a point of debate for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Trump is expected to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

Debt-Ceiling Battle  
This Time Around  
Offers New TwistsBy RICHARD RUBIN

WASHINGTON—Here we go again.

The U.S. government is hitting the debt limit, triggering a familiar cycle of brinkmanship, bipartisan negotiation and possible crisis. This round, however, has a few twists.

Republicans have the power to raise the debt ceiling by themselves, and they will try to do that in their tax, border, energy and spending-cuts legislation that would wrap many of President-elect Donald Trump's priorities into one bill.

"With all that we're doing to restore fiscal health and prosperity, we ought to put the debt ceiling in there as well, because those are the fiscal reforms that I think should be required to do it," said Rep. Jodey Arrington (R., Texas), chairman of the House Budget Committee. "And Trump's committed to it."

If Republicans' efforts collapse, they will need to turn to Democrats to avert a potential government default around the middle of the year, possibly setting the stage for more deadline drama. While many Democrats have made clear they won't sign off on a GOP plan that kicks the debt ceiling to the next Congress or next president, they have sig-

naled support for effectively getting rid of the debt-ceiling threat altogether.

Trump's recent call for a long-term or permanent debt-ceiling increase—which fell short among Republicans—could become the basis for an agreement with Democrats, said Rep. Brendan Boyle (D., Pa.). Boyle said he is open to working with Trump on a bill that would permanently alter the debt limit, aiming to prevent Republicans from wielding it against a future Democratic president like they did in 2011 and 2023.

"Both in our political interest and for the good of the country, this is a great opportunity for Democrats to once and for all permanently resolve this issue so it can never again be used as a weapon," said Boyle, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, who has introduced legislation that would let the administration raise the debt limit unless Congress objects with veto-proof majorities.

Trump, he said, "may actually be someone that Democrats can work with in order to achieve our long-term goals."

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) has said he wants to include a debt-limit increase in the "one big beautiful bill" that Republicans will

try to move through Congress using a procedure known as budget reconciliation, which averts the 60-vote Senate filibuster threshold. Republicans have a narrow 219-215 majority in the House, which is expected to temporarily shrink to 217-215 when two members join the administration.

Johnson reiterated Tuesday that Republicans want to handle the debt ceiling without relying on Democrats, but he acknowledged there was "a broad range of opinion" about the borrowing limit among GOP colleagues.

For decades, Congress periodically raised the limit, often tying it to budget agreements with few threats of a breach. Modern debt-limit politics started in 2011, when the Republican House insisted that any debt-ceiling increase be paired with spending cuts.

"They've certainly become more frequent, more often down to the wire and more political in nature," said Shai

Rep. Jodey Arrington (R., Texas) said Republicans should raise the debt limit as part of their broader fiscal legislation.

How the Debt Limit WorksThe debt limit is a weird creature. Congress created the limit before World War II to make debt management smoother while setting a cap on overall red ink to keep the legislature involved. But now the debt limit is a source of friction, failing to raise it threatens a global financial crisis.

Raising or freezing the debt limit doesn't change the U.S.'s fiscal trajectory.

Instead, raising the limit just lets the Treasury Department borrow money to implement Congress's prior tax and spending decisions.

Without a debt-limit increase, the U.S. would be unable to pay all its bills, at a minimum risking missed payments to federal workers or Medicare providers and potentially triggering damaging disruptions to the Treasury market.

Republicans repeated that strategy with President Biden in 2023. Both times, Republicans won concessions and Democrats insisted they would never again negotiate on the debt ceiling.

That 2023 deal suspended the limit until this month. Potential missed payments won't happen until later because the

Treasury Department can use tax revenue and extraordinary measures—moving money around government accounts—to stave off the so-called X date for a few more months.

Trump, seeing the ceiling on the horizon, asked Congress to include a debt-limit increase in an end-of-year spending bill in late 2024, a month before his inauguration. The vast majority of House Republicans voted for a two-year debt-limit suspension, even without spending cuts attached.

But enough House Republicans objected—joined by Democrats—to prevent that bill from passing, and the ultimate spending bill lacked a debt-limit increase. Trump asked Congress again to raise or eliminate the debt ceiling before he takes office Jan. 20, but lawmakers haven't acted.

"All I want to see is no default because nobody knows what would happen if there is a default," Trump said Tuesday. "It could be 1929 or it could be nothing."

Debt-limit votes can be politically difficult, because lawmakers don't like to be seen as enabling higher debt and deficits. The cuts demanded by some Republicans along with a debt-limit increase might prove unacceptable to other Republicans.

"When your House majority is one seat, it's just going to be really, really difficult to get a debt limit over the finish line simply with Republican votes," said Paul Winfree, who was a Trump aide in the first term and is now president of the Economic Policy Innovation Center.
