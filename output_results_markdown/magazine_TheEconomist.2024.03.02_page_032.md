erated much of India's economic success. Bangalore and Hyderabad, the capitals of Karnataka and Telangana, are home to most of India's leading tech companies as well as global giants, such as Amazon and Microsoft. Some 46% of India's tech "unicorns" are from the south, while 66% of the IT-services industry's exports come from there. Of Apple's 14 suppliers in India, 11 are in the south.

It looks like the futureAlong with Chennai, Tamil Nadu's capital, Bangalore and Hyderabad are also big destinations for foreign companies establishing "global capability centres" to provide in-house back-office services for a fraction of the cost back home. Of those that were set up recently, 79% were in the south. Fully 16% of India's factories are based in Tamil Nadu, making it a manufacturing hub.

As a result, living standards in the south are a world apart from the north. About 20% of India's population live in the five southern states, while some 26% do in just two of the poorest states in the north, Uttar Pradesh (or UP) and Bihar. Compared with those two places, GDP per person in the south is 4.2 times higher, while infant mortality rates are less than half. The average literacy rate of women aged between 15 and 49 in the south is among India's highest, averaging 86%. In UP and Bihar, the average is 70%.

The north-south divide is cultural, too. The BJP seeks to establish a Hindu-centric national identity that it says was suppressed for centuries by Muslim and British invaders. But that idea resonates far less in the south, where Islam arrived earlier and spread more peacefully. The region also has a long history of social activism aimed at modernising Hinduism and promoting local identity.

The BJP's challenge is particularly acute in Tamil Nadu. It has been controlled since the 1960s by parties stemming from the Dravidian movement, which began as a revolt against Brahmins (the highest of India's castes) dominating the civil service. That grew into a campaign to abolish the caste system and protect local language and culture. In the past Dravidian leaders agitated for an independent nation, too.

To try to break Dravidian parties' grip on power, the BJP appointed Mr Annamalai, a charismatic Tamil, as its state chief in 2021, two years after he resigned as a police officer. A farmer's son from a relatively low caste, he has run an aggressive campaign to mobilise young voters, especially in rural areas, and to counter Dravidian parties' accusations that the BJP is dominated by northern Brahmins. "Look at me: I'm a pukka Dravidian south Indian," he says.

"I'm rooting the BJP to the ground here."

And to build the party's presence in the state, he says he is putting "growth, growth and growth" at the centre of its campaign. "I don't think we need to respond to ideology with ideology," he adds. In particular, the BJP has to tread carefully on the idea of making Hindi a national language, as it has sometimes advocated. That issue has often provoked protests in the south, including deadly riots in Tamil Nadu in 1965.

When Mr Modi addressed the rally on February 27th, he avoided that subject but spoke of his love for local language and culture, recalling that he had quoted from a 6th century BC Tamil poem at the UN. He also avoided mentioning his inauguration of a controversial Hindu temple in northern India, despite its centrality to his campaign elsewhere. While outlining his government's support for Tamil Nadu, he praised the state's entrepreneurial spirit. (He mostly spoke in Hindi, however.)

Another problem for the BJP is that economic disparities between the north and the south have amplified political tensions. This is especially the case since Mr Modi introduced a national goods-and-services tax in 2017. Southern leaders complain that they get back from the central government only a fraction of their tax contributions. In February, they protested in Delhi, the capital, saying that Mr Modi's policy of distributing tax revenues among states based on population size effectively punished the south for its more successful family planning.

The marks of historyThe north-south dispute could escalate further with a revision of electoral boundaries, due after 2026. The process, known as "delimitation", could expand parliament's lower house from 543 seats to around 753, with most new ones going to the north. Tamil Nadu's chief minister, M.K. Stalin, has been especially critical, telling the local assembly on February 14th that "delimitation is a sword hanging over the head of Tamil Nadu."

BJP officials dismiss that as separatist scaremongering. Privately, though, they admit frustration with their party's performance in the south. They now believe that the combination of this year's election, delimitation and state polls in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in 2026 give it a rare chance to establish more of a foothold in the south. And they want to do that while the face of the party is still Mr Modi, whose popularity extends well beyond the Hindi heartland. "It's important to them to make the claim that they're not limited to Hindi-speaking India," says Sandeep Shastri, an expert on Indian politics. "They want to become a truly pan-Indian party," he says.

One southern state where the BJP has already made inroads is Karnataka, where
